75-100k         30       4          13.3%        64.7%
```

**CSV Data Analysis:**
```
Range           Total    Winners    Win Rate
----------------------------------------------------------------------
40-50k          7        3          42.9%        ‚≠ê EXCELLENT

100-200k        15       3          20.0%
```

**üèÜ WINNER: $35,000 - $75,000 Liquidity**
- **Server Win Rate:** 19.2% (35-50k range)
- **CSV Win Rate:** 42.9% (40-50k) and 44.4% (50-75k)
- **Top Winners Median:** $38,226 (server) and $61,886 (CSV)

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL INSIGHT:**
- Liquidity < $30k = 2.3% win rate (AVOID)
- Liquidity $35k-$75k = 19-44% win rate (OPTIMAL)
- Liquidity > $100k = declining win rate (saturated pools)

---

### 3. MOMENTUM PATTERNS

**6-Hour Momentum (STRONGEST PREDICTOR):**
```
6h Momentum        Total    Winners    Win Rate
-------------------------------------------------------
Strong Down        11       4          36.4%
Moderate Down      128      28         21.9%
Slight Up          378      33         8.7%
Moderate Up        25       10         40.0%        ‚≠ê BEST
```

**üèÜ WINNER: 20-50% 6-Hour Gain**
- **Win Rate:** 40.0%
- **CSV Confirmation:** Winners avg 25.6% vs losers 1.8%

**24-Hour Momentum:**
- **Winners avg:** 50.6% (server), 563.8% (CSV)
- **Losers avg:** 3.1% (server), 0.6% (CSV)
- **Insight:** Catching tokens with 6h momentum (20-50%) before they explode 24h

**1-Hour Momentum:**
- **Winners avg:** 0.0% (server), -3.3% (CSV)
- **Losers avg:** 0.0% (server), -0.1% (CSV)
- **Insight:** Flat or slightly negative 1h is GOOD (consolidation/dip buy)

---

### 4. BUY/SELL RATIO (CSV DATA ONLY)

**CRITICAL DIFFERENTIATOR:**
```
Winners:
  24h Buy/Sell: 24.26
  6h Buy/Sell: 25.61
  1h Buy/Sell: 26.57

Losers:
  24h Buy/Sell: 1.68
  6h Buy/Sell: 1.31
  1h Buy/Sell: 2.24
```

**üèÜ INSIGHT: Buy/Sell Ratio > 10 = STRONG BUY PRESSURE**
- Winners have 14x higher buy/sell ratio than losers
- This is a MASSIVE differentiator (not currently tracked by bot)

---

### 5. VOLUME/LIQUIDITY RATIO

**CSV Data:**
```
Winners:  Liq/Vol Ratio = 0.21 (high volume relative to liquidity)
Losers:   Liq/Vol Ratio = 1.24 (low volume relative to liquidity)
```

**üèÜ INSIGHT: Volume should be 3-5x Liquidity**
- Lower ratio = more trading activity = higher pump potential
- Bot currently doesn't track this metric

---

### 6. SCORE ANALYSIS

**Server Data:**
```
Score    Total    Winners    Win Rate     Avg Gain
------------------------------------------------------------
5        46       4          8.7%         28.7%
6        52       8          15.4%        161.3%
7        86       9          10.5%        41.1%
8        118      18         15.3%        50.1%
9        46       8          17.4%        108.4%
10       163      28         17.2%        78.3%
```

**üèÜ INSIGHT: Score 8-10 is optimal**
- Score 8: 15.3% win rate (good balance)
- Score 9-10: 17.2-17.4% win rate (best)
- Lowering to score 7 drops win rate to 10.5%

## üéØ RECOMMENDED BOT CONFIGURATION

### OPTIMAL CONFIG (Based on Data)

```env
# Market Cap
MIN_MARKET_CAP_USD=50000
MAX_MARKET_CAP_USD=130000          # Extended to capture moonshots

# Liquidity
MIN_LIQUIDITY_USD=35000            # Raised from 30k (2.3% ‚Üí 19% win rate)
MAX_LIQUIDITY_USD=75000

# Score
GENERAL_CYCLE_MIN_SCORE=8          # Keep at 8 (best balance)

# Momentum Filters
MAX_24H_CHANGE_FOR_ALERT=200       # Anti-FOMO (catch before explosion)
MAX_1H_CHANGE_FOR_ALERT=150

# Soft Ranking (Already Implemented)
# +1 bonus for:
# - Consolidation: 24h[50,200%] + 1h‚â§0 ‚Üí 35.5% win rate
# - Dip Buy: 24h[-50,-20%] + 1h‚â§0 ‚Üí 29.3% win rate
```

### NEW METRICS TO ADD (HIGH PRIORITY)

**1. Buy/Sell Ratio Filter (CRITICAL)**
```python
# In signal_processor.py
MIN_BUY_SELL_RATIO_24H = 3.0  # Conservative start (winners avg 24.26)
MIN_BUY_SELL_RATIO_6H = 3.0   # Conservative start (winners avg 25.61)

# If buy/sell ratio > 10: +1 score bonus (strong buy pressure)
# If buy/sell ratio < 2: reject signal (weak interest)
```

**2. Volume/Liquidity Ratio**
```python
# In analyze_token.py
MIN_VOLUME_TO_LIQUIDITY_RATIO = 2.0  # Volume should be 2x+ liquidity
# Winners avg: 4.76x (1/0.21)
# Losers avg: 0.81x (1/1.24)
```

**3. 6-Hour Momentum Sweet Spot**
```python
# In analyze_token.py
# +1 score bonus if 6h change is 20-50%
if 20 <= price_change_6h <= 50:
    score += 1
    scoring_details.append("‚≠ê OPTIMAL 6H MOMENTUM: +1 (20-50% range - 40% win rate!)")
```

## üìà EXPECTED IMPACT

### Current Config Performance
```
Market Cap: $50k-$100k
Liquidity: $30k-$75k
Min Score: 8
Win Rate: 19.6% (46 signals)
```

### Proposed Config Performance (Estimated)
```
Market Cap: $50k-$130k
Liquidity: $35k-$75k
Min Score: 8
+ Buy/Sell Ratio > 3
+ Volume/Liq Ratio > 2
+ 6h Momentum Bonus
Estimated Win Rate: 25-30%
Estimated Signal Frequency: 15-20/day
```

**Key Improvements:**
1. **+5-10% win rate** from liquidity floor raise (30k ‚Üí 35k)
2. **+3-5% win rate** from buy/sell ratio filter
3. **+2-3% win rate** from volume/liquidity filter
4. **Better signal quality** from 6h momentum bonus

## üö® CRITICAL INSIGHTS

### What Defines a 2x+ Pump?

**MUST HAVE:**
1. ‚úÖ Liquidity $35k-$75k (sweet spot)
2. ‚úÖ Market Cap $50k-$130k (micro-cap range)
3. ‚úÖ 6h momentum 20-50% (catching the wave)
4. ‚úÖ Buy/Sell ratio > 3 (buy pressure)

**NICE TO HAVE:**
5. ‚úÖ Volume 2-5x liquidity (high activity)
6. ‚úÖ Score 8-10 (quality signal)
7. ‚úÖ 1h momentum ‚â§ 0 (consolidation/dip buy)

**AVOID:**
- ‚ùå Liquidity < $30k (2.3% win rate)
- ‚ùå Liquidity > $100k (saturated)
- ‚ùå 24h change > 200% (FOMO trap)
- ‚ùå Buy/Sell ratio < 2 (weak interest)

## üõ†Ô∏è IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (Immediate)
1. **Raise MIN_LIQUIDITY_USD to $35,000**
   - Expected: +5-10% win rate
   - Risk: -10-15% signal frequency

2. **Extend MAX_MARKET_CAP_USD to $130,000**
   - Expected: +5-10% signal frequency
   - Risk: Minimal (still micro-cap range)

### Phase 2: New Metrics (1-2 days)
3. **Add Buy/Sell Ratio Tracking**
   - Fetch from DexScreener API
   - Filter: ratio > 3
   - Bonus: ratio > 10 ‚Üí +1 score

4. **Add Volume/Liquidity Ratio**
   - Calculate: volume_24h / liquidity
   - Filter: ratio > 2.0

5. **Add 6h Momentum Bonus**
   - +1 score if 20% ‚â§ change_6h ‚â§ 50%

### Phase 3: ML Enhancement (Ongoing)
6. **Retrain ML with new features**
   - Add buy/sell ratio
   - Add volume/liquidity ratio
   - Add 6h momentum
   - Expected: ML R¬≤ improves from -0.01 to 0.1-0.2

## üìä VALIDATION METRICS

**After implementing changes, monitor:**

```sql
-- Win rate (target: 25-30%)
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as signals,
    SUM(CASE WHEN max_gain_percent >= 100 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as winners,
    ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN max_gain_percent >= 100 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 1) as win_rate
FROM alerted_tokens a
JOIN alerted_token_stats s ON a.token_address = s.token_address
WHERE a.alerted_at > (strftime('%s', 'now') - 604800);

-- Liquidity distribution (target: 100% in 35-75k range)
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN first_liquidity_usd < 35000 THEN 'Below 35k'
        WHEN first_liquidity_usd < 75000 THEN '35k-75k (TARGET)'
        ELSE 'Above 75k'
    END as range,
    COUNT(*) as signals
FROM alerted_token_stats
WHERE first_alert_at > (strftime('%s', 'now') - 604800)
GROUP BY range;
```
