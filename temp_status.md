# üöÄ CallsBot Status Report
**Last Updated:** October 11, 2025 - 9:27 PM IST  
**üéØ MAJOR UPDATE:** Anti-FOMO Filter Deployed!  
**System Health:** ‚úÖ **ALL SYSTEMS GO - EARLY ENTRY DETECTION ACTIVE**

---

## üî• **BREAKING: ANTI-FOMO FILTER DEPLOYED (9:27 PM IST)**

### **Problem Solved: Late Entry Detection**

**Previous Issue:**
- Bot was catching tokens AFTER they pumped (late entries)
- RAFPAF: +1,469% in 24h ‚Üí then -56% from alert
- Missing the early momentum (5-50% ideal zone)

**Solution Deployed:**
```
‚úÖ MAX_24H_CHANGE_FOR_ALERT: 100%  (reject if already >100% in 24h)
‚úÖ MAX_1H_CHANGE_FOR_ALERT: 300%   (reject extreme pumps)
‚úÖ SCORING PENALTY: -2 points if >150% in 24h
‚úÖ EARLY MOMENTUM DETECTION: 5-50% = ideal entry zone
```

**Impact:**
- ‚ùå **REJECT:** Tokens already pumped >100% in 24h (late entry!)
- ‚úÖ **ACCEPT:** Early momentum 5-50% (ideal entry)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  **CAUTION:** 50-100% (moderate pump, but within limits)

### **How It Works:**

**Entry Zones:**
1. **üéØ IDEAL (5-50% in 24h):** Early momentum, bot will prioritize these
2. **‚ö†Ô∏è  MODERATE (50-100%):** Getting late, but still passes filter
3. **‚ùå REJECTED (>100%):** Already mooned, late entry risk

**What You'll See in Logs:**
```
‚úÖ EARLY MOMENTUM: ... - 23.4% (ideal entry zone!)
‚ö†Ô∏è  MODERATE PUMP: ... - 78.5% (getting late, but within limits)
‚ùå REJECTED (LATE ENTRY - 24H PUMP): ... - 1469.5% > 100% (already mooned!)
```

---

## üéØ **HOW THE BOT NOW WORKS**

### **Core Ideology Change: EARLY ENTRY FOCUS**

**Before (OLD):**
- ‚ùå Caught tokens at ANY stage (even after 1,469% pump!)
- ‚ùå No distinction between early momentum vs late pump
- ‚ùå Rewarded positive 24h change without upper limit
- ‚ùå Result: Late entries that already peaked

**After (NEW):**
- ‚úÖ **Early Entry Detection:** Target 5-50% momentum
- ‚úÖ **Late Entry Rejection:** Block >100% 24h pumps
- ‚úÖ **Smart Scoring:** Penalize >150% with -2 points
- ‚úÖ **Result:** Catch tokens BEFORE they moon

### **Signal Detection Logic:**

#### **1. Liquidity Filter (First Gate)**
```
Minimum: $25,000 (was $30k, adjusted for flow)
Excellent: $50,000+
Zero/NaN: REJECTED
```

#### **2. ANTI-FOMO Filter (NEW - Critical Gate)**
```
IF change_24h > 100%:
    ‚ùå REJECT (Late Entry - Already Mooned!)
    
IF change_1h > 300%:
    ‚ùå REJECT (Extreme Pump - Too Late!)
    
IF 5% <= change_24h <= 50%:
    ‚úÖ EARLY MOMENTUM (Ideal Entry Zone!)
    
ELSE:
    ‚úÖ PASS (Within acceptable range)
```

#### **3. Scoring System (With Anti-FOMO Penalty)**
```
Base Score: 0-10 points
- Market Cap: +2-3 (lower = better)
- Liquidity: +2-3 (higher = better)
- Volume: +1-2 (activity indicators)
- Momentum 1h: +1-2 (short-term trend)

NEW PENALTY:
- IF change_24h > 150%: -2 points (late entry risk!)

Minimum Score: 6/10 (general cycle)
```

#### **4. Security & Risk Gates**
```
- LP Locked: Optional (if data available)
- Mint Revoked: Optional (if data available)
- Top 10 Holders: <18% concentration
```

### **Key Differences (Before vs After):**

| Aspect | Before | After (Oct 11, 9:27 PM IST) |
|--------|---------|------------------------------|
| **Late Entry Detection** | ‚ùå None | ‚úÖ Reject >100% in 24h |
| **Entry Target** | Any positive momentum | 5-50% ideal zone |
| **Scoring Logic** | Reward all gains | Penalize excessive pumps |
| **Risk Management** | Post-entry only | Pre-entry filtering |
| **Result** | Mixed (late + early) | **Early entries only** |

## üîß Monitoring Commands

### 1. **Check Anti-FOMO Filter in Action**
```bash
ssh root@64.227.157.221 "docker logs callsbot-worker --tail 100 | grep -E 'FOMO|LATE ENTRY|EARLY MOMENTUM'"
```

**Expected Output:**
```
‚úÖ EARLY MOMENTUM: ... - 23.4% (ideal entry zone!)
‚ùå REJECTED (LATE ENTRY - 24H PUMP): ... - 156.2% > 100% (already mooned!)
‚úÖ FOMO CHECK PASSED: ... - 8.7% in 24h
```

### 2. **Monitor Signal Quality**
```bash
ssh root@64.227.157.221 "docker logs callsbot-worker --tail 50"
```

**Look for:**
- ‚úÖ Early momentum detections (5-50% range)
- ‚ùå Late entry rejections (>100% pumps)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  Moderate pumps passing through (50-100%)

### 3. **Check System Health**
```bash
ssh root@64.227.157.221 "cd /opt/callsbotonchain/deployment && docker compose ps"
```

**Expected:** All containers "healthy"

---

## üìà **Expected Impact**

### **Immediate (Next 6 Hours):**
1. **Signal Quality:** Higher (only early entries)
2. **Late Entries:** Zero (rejected at gate)
3. **Win Rate:** Should improve (entering early)
4. **Risk Reduction:** Fewer "already pumped" tokens

### **Medium Term (24-48 Hours):**
1. **Performance Tracking:** Better entry prices
2. **ML Data Quality:** Clean training data (early entries only)
3. **User Experience:** More profitable signals
4. **Confidence:** Trust in early detection

### **Red Flags to Watch:**
1. **Zero signals for 2+ hours:** Filter may be too strict (unlikely with 100% threshold)
2. **All rejections are "LATE ENTRY":** Market may be overheated
3. **No "EARLY MOMENTUM" logs:** Feed may not have fresh tokens

---

## üí° **Telegram Notification Latency**

### **Current Status: OPTIMIZED** ‚úÖ

**Notification Flow:**
```
1. Feed Scan (every 60s) ‚Üí 2. Token Evaluation (<1s) ‚Üí 
3. Scoring & Filters (<1s) ‚Üí 4. Telegram Send (<2s)
```

**Total Latency:** ~3-5 seconds from detection to delivery

**Optimization Already in Place:**
- ‚úÖ Parallel API calls (no sequential bottlenecks)
- ‚úÖ Telethon fallback (user API, faster than bot API)
- ‚úÖ No throttling delay (TELEGRAM_ALERT_MIN_INTERVAL = 0)
- ‚úÖ Direct message (no queuing)

**Why Latency is Minimal:**
1. Worker processes feed in real-time (no batch delay)
2. Telethon sends instantly (bypass bot API rate limits)
3. Redis push for traders (parallel delivery)
4. No confirmation waits (fire-and-forget)

**Further Optimization (if needed):**
- Reduce FETCH_INTERVAL from 60s to 30s (more aggressive scanning)
- Enable WebSocket feed (real-time vs polling) - requires Cielo websocket support

---

## üéØ **Success Indicators (Next 24 Hours)**

### **‚úÖ Good Signs:**
1. Logs show "EARLY MOMENTUM" rejections
2. Signals appear with 5-50% 24h change
3. Late entry rejections visible (>100% blocked)
4. Tracking shows better entry prices
5. Fewer immediate losses after alert

### **‚ö†Ô∏è  Warning Signs:**
1. Zero signals for 6+ hours (filter too strict?)
2. All signals still >100% (filter not working?)
3. Container crashes (code issue)

### **üö® Red Flags (Immediate Action):**
1. Worker stopped/crashed
2. No "FOMO" logs at all (filter not active)
3. Database errors
4. All late entries still passing
