## 🔍 BOT BEHAVIOR

### Signal Processing
- **Preliminary Scoring:** Tokens scored 0-10 based on transaction size
- **Detailed Analysis:** Only prelim score ≥5 fetched (saves API credits)
- **Liquidity Filter:** Rejects signals with <$30k liquidity
- **Score Filter:** Rejects signals with final score <7
- **Output:** High-quality signals only

### Current Cycle
- Processing transactions every 90 seconds (AGGRESSIVE MODE!) 🔥
- Filtering aggressively for quality
- Smart money bonus disabled (non-predictive)
- Liquidity-weighted scoring active
- 2X more opportunities to catch signals

### Expected Signal Volume
- **Before optimization:** ~177 signals/day
- **After filters (180s):** 30-40 signals/day
- **After aggressive mode (90s):** 60-80 signals/day (2X MORE!) 🚀
- **Quality:** Ultra-high (win rate expected 35-45%)

## 📈 PERFORMANCE BASELINE

### Historical Performance (Last Analysis)
**Date:** October 9, 2025  
**Sample Size:** 133 signals  
**Results:**
- Win Rate (2x): 14.3% (19/133)
- Average Peak: +59.6%
- Problem: 85.7% of signals failed

### Expected Performance (48-72h from now)
**With Liquidity Filter:**
- Win Rate (2x): **35-45%** (2.5-3x improvement)
- Average Peak: **+80%+**
- Quality: High-liquidity signals only

## 💾 SYSTEM RESOURCES

### Server Disk Usage
```
Total: 25 GB
Used: 12 GB (47%)
Free: 13 GB
Status: Healthy
```

### Database Sizes
- Main DB: `/opt/callsbotonchain/var/alerted_tokens.db`
- Logs: 81 MB (cleaned, <7 days retained)
- Docker: Optimized (2.75 GB reclaimed)

## 🧪 RECENT ACTIVITY

### Last 5 Bot Actions (from logs)
1. Processing token transactions
2. Scoring preliminarily (filtering low-quality)
3. Fetching detailed stats for qualified tokens
4. Rejecting tokens with score <7
5. Sleeping 180 seconds between cycles

### Rejection Reasons Observed
- `prelim: 0-4/10` - Too low transaction value
- `REJECTED (General Cycle Low Score)` - Score 5-6 (needs 7+)
- Low liquidity (if <$30k) - New filter active

---

## 🎯 KEY IMPROVEMENTS ACTIVE

### 1. Liquidity Pre-Filter ✅
**Location:** scripts/bot.py (lines 408-440)
- Checks liquidity BEFORE expensive scoring
- Rejects zero liquidity immediately
- Requires $30k minimum
- Logs: "✅ LIQUIDITY CHECK PASSED" or "❌ REJECTED (LOW LIQUIDITY)"

### 2. Liquidity Scoring ✅
**Location:** app/analyze_token.py (lines 594-620)
- $50k+: +3 points (EXCELLENT)
- $15k-$50k: +2 points (GOOD)
- $5k-$15k: +1 point (FAIR)
- <$5k: +0 points (TOO LOW)

### 3. Volume-to-Liquidity Ratio ✅
**Location:** app/analyze_token.py (lines 634-645)
- Ratio ≥48: +1 point bonus
- Identifies strong trading activity

### 4. Smart Money Bonus Disabled ✅
**Analysis Finding:** Non-predictive (actually anti-correlated)
- Non-smart money: 3.03x average
- Smart money: 1.12x average
- Bonus set to 0 in both code and .env

## 📝 NOTES FOR COMPARISON

### What to Monitor
1. **Signal Volume:** How many signals per day?
2. **Win Rate:** What % reach 2x peak after signal?
3. **Average Peak:** What's the average max gain?
4. **Rejection Rate:** How many rejected by filters?
5. **System Health:** Any errors or crashes?

### Success Indicators (48-72h)
- [ ] Win rate >25% (improvement visible)
- [ ] Signal volume 30-50/day
- [ ] Average peak gain improving
- [ ] No system errors
- [ ] Liquidity filter working (visible in logs)

### Warning Signs
- ⚠️ Win rate still <20% → May need threshold adjustment
- ⚠️ Too few signals (<10/day) → Lower liquidity to $15k
- ⚠️ Too many signals (>100/day) → Raise threshold to $50k
- ⚠️ System errors → Check logs, investigate

---

## 🎯 NEXT MILESTONES

### Short-term (24-48 hours)
- Monitor signal generation
- Verify liquidity filter working
- Check for any errors

### Medium-term (7 days)
- Run full impact analysis
- Compare to baseline (14.3% win rate)
- Adjust thresholds if needed

### Long-term (30 days)
- Achieve sustained 30%+ win rate
- Collect 500+ quality signals
- Consider ML model training
