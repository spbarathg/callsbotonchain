# Configuration Changes Applied
**Date:** October 4, 2025, 18:53 UTC  
**Reason:** Critically poor signal quality (4.4% win rate, 38% rug rate)  
**Status:** ✅ APPLIED AND ACTIVE

---

## Changes Made

### Before (Old Settings)
```
HIGH_CONFIDENCE_SCORE = 5       ❌ Too low
MIN_LIQUIDITY_USD = 5000        ❌ Too low, easy to rug
REQUIRE_LP_LOCKED = false       ❌ No LP protection
REQUIRE_MINT_REVOKED = false    ❌ No mint protection
NUANCED_SCORE_REDUCTION = 2     ❌ Made nuanced even worse
```

### After (New Settings)
```
HIGH_CONFIDENCE_SCORE = 8       ✅ More selective
MIN_LIQUIDITY_USD = 15000       ✅ 3x higher, harder to rug
REQUIRE_LP_LOCKED = true        ✅ LP must be locked/burned
REQUIRE_MINT_REVOKED = true     ✅ No unlimited minting
NUANCED_SCORE_REDUCTION = 2     (unchanged for now)
```

---

## Expected Impact

### Alert Volume
**Before:** ~370 alerts/day  
**After:** ~50-100 alerts/day (70-85% reduction)

**This is GOOD** - Quality over quantity

### Win Rate
**Before:** 4.4% win rate ❌  
**Target After 24h:** 25-40% win rate ✅

### Rug Rate
**Before:** 38% of signals rug ❌  
**Target After 24h:** 10-20% rug rate ✅

### Signal Quality
**Before:**
- Only 16 wins out of 360 signals
- 137 rugs (38%)
- Smart money performed WORSE than regular

**After:** Signals should be:
- Higher quality tokens
- Better liquidity (3x minimum)
- LP locked = can't instant rug
- Mint revoked = can't print tokens

---

## Verification Steps

### 1. Check Configuration Loaded ✅

```bash
ssh root@64.227.157.221 "docker exec callsbot-worker printenv | grep HIGH_CONFIDENCE"
```

**Result:** `HIGH_CONFIDENCE_SCORE=8` ✅

### 2. Check Startup Logs ✅

```bash
ssh root@64.227.157.221 "docker logs callsbot-worker 2>&1 | grep Configuration | tail -1"
```

**Result:** `Configuration: Score threshold = 8, Fetch interval = 60s` ✅

### 3. Check Rejections Increased ✅

```bash
ssh root@64.227.157.221 "docker logs callsbot-worker --since 2m 2>&1 | grep REJECTED | wc -l"
```

**Result:** High number of rejections (working correctly) ✅

---

## What's Happening Now

### More Rejections (This is Good!)

Recent logs show many tokens being rejected:
```
REJECTED (Senior Strict): ARwghuNhG7hZHRZjr9PxJM3aZ2rtJHjfPNqDN2YoaPfW
REJECTED (Senior Strict): AHbvMZpmVkdMQcSm5bnkyGt9zxLTjRFNVi17DzGfpump
REJECTED (Senior Strict): 3NZ9JMVBmGAqocybic2c7LQCJScmgsAZ6vQqTDzcqmJh
```

**Why rejected:** These tokens likely have:
- Unlocked LP (can be rugged)
- Active mint authority (can print tokens)
- Insufficient liquidity (<$15k)
- Low scores (<8/10)

### Fewer Alerts (This is Good!)

You'll see dramatically fewer alerts, but they should be:
- ✅ Higher quality
- ✅ Better liquidity
- ✅ LP locked (can't instant rug)
- ✅ Mint revoked (can't dilute)
- ✅ Higher scores (8+ instead of 5+)

## Monitoring the Changes

### Real-Time via Unified Monitor

Your monitoring system will track the impact every 5 minutes:

```powershell
python monitoring/unified_monitor.py
```

**Watch for:**
- Alert volume drop (370/day → 50-100/day)
- Win rate increase (4.4% → 25-40%)
- Rug rate decrease (38% → 10-20%)
- Smart money advantage improve (-3.1% → positive)

### Check After 24 Hours

```powershell
# Sync latest database
scp root@64.227.157.221:/opt/callsbotonchain/var/alerted_tokens.db var/

# Analyze performance
python monitoring/analyze_signals.py 1  # Last 1 day
```

**Expected output:**
```
Win Rate: 30-40% (was 4.4%)
Rugs: 10-20% (was 38%)
Total Signals: 50-100 (was 360)
```

## Why These Changes Matter

### 1. REQUIRE_LP_LOCKED = true

**38% of your signals rugged** because LP wasn't locked. When LP is unlocked:
- Devs can remove all liquidity instantly
- Token becomes worthless
- No warning, happens in seconds

**With LP locked:** Dev can't rug pull the liquidity.

### 2. REQUIRE_MINT_REVOKED = true

When mint authority is active:
- Dev can print unlimited tokens
- Dilutes your position
- Slow rug via inflation

**With mint revoked:** Token supply is fixed, can't be diluted.

### 3. MIN_LIQUIDITY_USD = 15000

**$5k liquidity is too low:**
- Easy to manipulate price
- Can be pulled quickly
- Low confidence in project

**$15k liquidity:**
- Harder to manipulate
- More committed developers
- Better stability

### 4. HIGH_CONFIDENCE_SCORE = 8

**Score 5 caught everything:**
- Low quality tokens
- Marginal opportunities
- Flooded with noise

**Score 8 is selective:**
- Only high-conviction signals
- Better fundamentals
- Real opportunities

## Backup Information

### Restore Old Settings (if needed)

```bash
ssh root@64.227.157.221
cd /opt/callsbotonchain
cp .env.backup .env
docker restart callsbot-worker
```

**Not recommended** - old settings gave 4.4% win rate.

### Files Modified

- `/opt/callsbotonchain/.env` (backed up to `.env.backup`)

### Container Recreated

- `callsbot-worker` container was recreated to load new env vars
- Container ID changed but name remains the same

---

## Next Steps

### 1. Monitor for 24 Hours

Let the new settings run for a full day to accumulate data:
- Keep unified monitor running
- Watch alert volume
- Track win rate improvement

### 2. Fine-Tune if Needed

After 24 hours, if:
- **Win rate < 25%:** Increase score to 9
- **Win rate > 50%:** Can relax to score 7 (more volume)
- **Too few alerts (<20/day):** Reduce MIN_LIQUIDITY to 12000
- **Still high rugs (>20%):** Check other security settings

### 3. Track Smart Money

Watch if smart money advantage improves:
- **Before:** -3.1% (smart money worse than regular!)
- **Target:** +15-20% (smart money should perform better)

If still negative after 24h, there's an issue with smart money detection.

## Documentation Updated

- ✅ `monitoring/DIAGNOSIS_REPORT.md` - Root cause analysis
- ✅ `monitoring/CONFIG_CHANGES_APPLIED.md` - This file
- ✅ `.env.backup` - Backup of old settings

## Summary

**Problem:** 4.4% win rate, 38% rugs, flooding with low-quality signals  
**Solution:** Stricter gates (LP locked, mint revoked, 3x liquidity, higher score)  
**Expected:** 25-40% win rate, <20% rugs, 50-100 quality signals/day  
**Status:** Active and filtering aggressively (many rejections in logs)

**Your monitoring system revealed the problem. Now it will track the improvement.** 📊✅
