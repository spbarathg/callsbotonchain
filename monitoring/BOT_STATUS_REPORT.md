# Bot Status Report - October 5, 2025 02:46 UTC

## ✅ **SYSTEM STATUS: OPERATIONAL**

All components are running correctly with the new stricter configuration.

---

## 🔧 **Configuration Now Active**

```json
{
  "HIGH_CONFIDENCE_SCORE": 9,          // ✅ Changed from 8
  "MIN_LIQUIDITY_USD": 20000,          // ✅ Changed from 15000
  "MAX_MARKET_CAP_FOR_DEFAULT_ALERT": 750000,  // ✅ Changed from 1000000
  "VOL_TO_MCAP_RATIO_MIN": 0.2,        // ✅ Changed from 0.15
  "REQUIRE_MINT_REVOKED": true,
  "REQUIRE_LP_LOCKED": true,
  "GATE_MODE": "CUSTOM"
}
```

**Additional Settings:**
- `MAX_TOP10_CONCENTRATION=18` (changed from 30)
- `ALLOW_UNKNOWN_SECURITY=false` (changed from true)
- `MIN_USD_VALUE=300` (changed from 200)
- `PRELIM_DETAILED_MIN=3` (changed from 2)

## 📡 **Feed Status: WORKING**

### Current Activity:
- **Feed Items per Cycle:** 80-84 transactions
- **Cycle Mode:** Alternating between "general" and "smart" feeds
- **Processing:** ✅ Active
- **Heartbeat:** ✅ Regular (every ~60 seconds)
- **API Calls Saved:** 233+ (zero-miss mode working)

### Recent Heartbeat:
```json
{
  "cycle": "general",
  "feed_items": 84,
  "processed_count": 0,
  "alerts_sent": 0,
  "ts": "2025-10-04T21:16:40.910380"
}
```

## 🎯 **Signal Status: ZERO ALERTS (EXPECTED)**

### Why No Signals?

**This is NORMAL and EXPECTED behavior** with the new strict settings:

1. **Higher Score Threshold:** Score must be 9/10 (was 8/10)
2. **Preliminary Gate:** Tokens need prelim score ≥3 to even get analyzed (was ≥2)
3. **Holder Concentration:** Top 10 holders must own <18% (was <30%)
4. **Security Requirements:** Must have verified LP lock + mint revoked
5. **Higher Liquidity:** Minimum $20k (was $15k)
6. **Better Volume Ratio:** 20% vol/mcap (was 15%)
7. **Market Cap Ceiling:** Max $750k (was $1M)

### What's Happening:

**Feed Processing:**
- 80-84 transactions being analyzed per cycle ✅
- Tokens getting preliminary scores (1/10, 2/10, 3/10)
- Most tokens **skip detailed analysis** (prelim <3)
- Tokens that get analyzed are **REJECTED by gates**

**Example from Logs:**
```
Token prelim: 2/10 (skipped detailed analysis)  → Too low, not analyzed
Token prelim: 3/10 → FETCHING DETAILED STATS   → Gets analyzed
→ REJECTED (Senior Strict)                     → Doesn't pass final gates
```

## 📊 **Historical Context**

### Before Changes (Last 24 Hours):
- **Signals:** 373 alerts
- **Win Rate:** 5.4%
- **Rug Rate:** 63% (235 rugs!)
- **Quality:** Very poor

### After Changes (26 Minutes Running):
- **Signals:** 0 alerts
- **Expected:** 0-2 alerts per hour (maybe)
- **Quality:** Should be MUCH higher when they come

**The bot is now extremely selective** - it may go hours without sending a signal, but when it does, the signal should be significantly higher quality.

---

## 🚨 **Potential Issues to Monitor**

### Too Strict?
If the bot goes **6+ hours with zero signals**, the settings may be TOO strict. We can relax:
- Lower `HIGH_CONFIDENCE_SCORE` back to 8
- Reduce `PRELIM_DETAILED_MIN` back to 2
- Increase `MAX_TOP10_CONCENTRATION` to 22-25%

### Just Right?
If we see **2-10 signals per day** with:
- Win rate >15%
- Rug rate <25%
- Good average gains
Then the settings are **perfect**.

### Still Too Loose?
If we get **20+ signals per day** with:
- Still high rug rate (>40%)
- Low win rate (<10%)
Then we need to **tighten further**.

## 🔍 **Container Status**

```
callsbot-worker   ✅ Up 30s (healthy)
callsbot-web      ✅ Up 2 hours
callsbot-trader   ✅ Up 12 hours (healthy)
callsbot-proxy    ✅ Up 2 hours
```

**Last Restart:** 2025-10-05 02:46:32 IST (21:16:32 UTC)  
**Reason:** Applied new configuration  
**Status:** Successfully loaded new config

---

## 📈 **What to Watch**

### Next 1-2 Hours:
- [ ] Monitor for ANY signal (even 1 would validate config is working)
- [ ] Check rejection reasons in logs
- [ ] Verify feed continues processing

### Next 24 Hours:
- [ ] Signal count (target: 5-15 signals)
- [ ] Win rate on any signals sent
- [ ] Rug rate reduction
- [ ] Time to first signal (if >6h, may be too strict)

### Commands to Monitor:
```bash
# Check if any signals came through
python monitoring/unified_monitor.py

# Check recent logs
ssh root@64.227.157.221 "cd /opt/callsbotonchain && docker compose logs --tail 100 worker | grep 'ALERT'"

# Check heartbeats
ssh root@64.227.157.221 "cd /opt/callsbotonchain && docker compose logs worker | grep heartbeat | tail -3"
```

## 💡 **Recommendations**

1. **Be Patient:** Let it run for at least 6-12 hours before judging
2. **First Signal is Key:** When the first alert comes, check if it's actually high quality
3. **Track Outcomes:** The first 5-10 signals will tell us if settings are good
4. **Adjust if Needed:** Based on data, not feelings

## 🎯 **Success Metrics (24h from now)**

| Metric | Current | Target | Stretch Goal |
|--------|---------|--------|--------------|
| **Signal Volume** | 373/day | 5-20/day | 10-15/day |
| **Win Rate** | 5.4% | >10% | >20% |
| **Rug Rate** | 63% | <30% | <20% |

## 📝 **Notes**

- Configuration changes took 2 container restarts to apply (first restart didn't pick up new env vars)
- Feed is processing normally (80+ items per cycle)
- Telegram notifications failing (host_not_allowed) but this is separate issue
- Bot is in production mode (dry_run=false)
- Trading is disabled (as expected)
- Database tracking 384 historical alerts

---

## ⏰ **Next Check-In**

**Scheduled:** October 5, 2025 08:00 UTC (6 hours from now)  
**Purpose:** Verify at least 1-2 signals have been sent  
**Action if Zero Signals:** Consider relaxing one setting (HIGH_CONFIDENCE_SCORE → 8)
