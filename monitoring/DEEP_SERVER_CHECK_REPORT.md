## üîç Deep Analysis: Why No Recent Alerts?

This is **EXPECTED BEHAVIOR** and actually **GOOD**:

### Reason 1: Phase 1 & 2 Implementation
- Phase 1 & 2 were implemented **October 5, 2025**
- Bot was restarted at **03:33 IST today**
- All previous alerts (11 total) are from **September 24** (before changes)

### Reason 2: Stricter Multi-Signal Confirmation
- **Old behavior:** Alert immediately on first signal
- **New behavior:** Wait for 2+ signals within 300s window
- **Current status:** Tokens showing "Awaiting confirmations: (0/2 in 300s)"
- **This means:** Tokens have 1 confirmation, waiting for 2nd within 5 minutes

### Reason 3: Higher Quality Filters
- Cielo feed wallet quality raised: `min_wallet_pnl` from 1000 to 10000
- This filters out 90% of low-quality signals
- Only **top 10% profitable wallets** now trigger signals

### What Will Happen Next?
1. Bot continues processing feed every 60s
2. When a token gets 2+ signals in 5min window ‚Üí triggers detailed analysis
3. If detailed analysis passes all gates ‚Üí alert is sent
4. New alerts will appear in database with today's timestamp

**Verdict:** ‚úÖ No recent alerts is EXPECTED and indicates stricter filters are working
