# 🚀 DEPLOYMENT COMPLETE - October 16, 2025 01:38 IST

## ✅ All Optimizations Successfully Deployed and Active

### 📊 Verified Configuration
```
FETCH_INTERVAL=45           ✅ (was 60s - 33% more feed checks)
PRELIM_DETAILED_MIN=1       ✅ (was 2 - catch early micro-caps)  
MIN_LIQUIDITY_USD=15000     ✅ (was 18000 - earlier entries)
MAX_24H_CHANGE=800%         ✅ (was 500% - catch ongoing mooners)
MAX_1H_CHANGE=500%          ✅ (was 300% - catch parabolic moves)
GENERAL_CYCLE_MIN_SCORE=4   ✅ (was 5 - more opportunities)
```

### 🎯 Live Evidence - Optimizations Working:
```
✅ "Fetch interval = 45s" - Confirmed in startup logs
✅ "FETCHING DETAILED STATS... prelim: 1/10" - Catching early tokens!
✅ "Sleeping for 45 seconds..." - Faster feed polling active
✅ Container: HEALTHY status
✅ CPU: 3.65% (excellent)
✅ Memory: 30.8MB (efficient)
```

### 📝 Commits Deployed:
1. **09f486d** - perf: Optimize signal frequency and quality parameters
2. **23adca7** - fix: Critical bug fixes and code optimization  
3. **e26f468** - docs: Add optimization summary and deployment guide

### 🔧 Changes Made:
**Code Changes:**
- ✅ app/config_unified.py - 16 parameter optimizations
- ✅ app/fetch_feed.py - NaN/Inf validation fix
- ✅ app/ml_scorer.py - Feature validation added
- ✅ scripts/bot.py - Removed 512 lines of dead code

**Environment Changes:**
- ✅ Removed conflicting .env overrides (MIN_LIQUIDITY_USD, VOL_TO_MCAP, PRELIM_DETAILED_MIN, GENERAL_CYCLE_MIN_SCORE)
- ✅ Set FETCH_INTERVAL=45 in deployment/.env
- ✅ Clean restart with --force-recreate

**Documentation:**
- ✅ Organized all docs into proper subdirectories
- ✅ Created OPTIMIZATION_SUMMARY.md
- ✅ Root directory decluttered

### 📈 Expected Performance Impact

**Signal Frequency:**
```
Before: 121 signals/day (5.0/hour)
After:  170-200 signals/day (7.1-8.3/hour) 
Boost:  +40-60% more signals
```

**Quality Target:**
```
Current: 17.6% 2x+ hit rate (EXCEEDS target!)
Goal:    Maintain 15-20% 2x+ rate
```

**Key Benefits:**
1. ⚡ **33% Faster Feed Polling** - 45s intervals catch tokens earlier
2. 🎯 **Catch Prelim 1 Tokens** - Previously blocked, now analyzed (WORKING!)
3. 🚀 **Allow Ongoing Pumps** - Up to 8x (24h) and 5x (1h) momentum
4. 💰 **Earlier Liquidity Entry** - $15k threshold for micro-cap opportunities  
5. 📊 **More Score 4+ Signals** - Lowered minimum score gates
6. 🔒 **Maintain Quality** - All rug filters still active

### 🏥 System Health

**Worker Container:**
- Status: HEALTHY ✅
- Uptime: 58 seconds (fresh restart)
- CPU: 3.65% (excellent)
- Memory: 30.8MB / 957MB (3.22%)

**All Services:**
```
callsbot-worker       ✅ HEALTHY
callsbot-tracker      ✅ HEALTHY (7 hours up)
callsbot-paper-trader ✅ HEALTHY (7 hours up)
callsbot-trader       ✅ HEALTHY (7 hours up)
callsbot-redis        ✅ HEALTHY (7 hours up)
callsbot-proxy        ✅ UP (7 hours up)
callsbot-web          ✅ UP (7 hours up)
```

### 📊 Monitoring Plan

**Next 6 Hours:**
- Monitor signal frequency (should increase to 7-8/hour)
- Verify prelim 1/10 tokens continue to be analyzed
- Check for any errors or issues
- Confirm 45s feed interval is consistent

**Next 24 Hours:**
- Calculate total signal volume (target: 170-200/day)
- Measure 2x+ hit rate (target: maintain 15-20%)
- Identify any parabolic catches (1h > 300%)
- Review liquidity distribution

**Next 48 Hours:**
- Full performance analysis
- Compare to 17.6% baseline
- Document any improvements
- Fine-tune if needed

### 🔄 Rollback (if needed)

If performance degrades below 12% 2x+ hit rate:

```bash
ssh root@64.227.157.221
cd /opt/callsbotonchain
git reset --hard 9305617  # Previous stable commit
cd deployment
docker compose up -d --force-recreate worker
```
