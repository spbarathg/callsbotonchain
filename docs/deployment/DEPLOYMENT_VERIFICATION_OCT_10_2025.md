```
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/vda1        25G   12G   13G  47% /
```

### 4. Documentation Organized
**Local Workspace Cleaned:**
- Created `docs/deployment/` folder
- Created `docs/ml_analysis/` folder
- Moved deployment documentation to proper folders
- Moved ML dataset (signals_ml_perfect.csv) to ml_analysis
- Removed unnecessary files from root

## üîç CURRENT ACTIVE CONFIGURATION

### Bot Settings
```
Score Threshold: 7
Liquidity Minimum: $30,000
Smart Money Bonus: 0
Fetch Interval: 180s
```

### Liquidity Filter
```
‚úÖ ACTIVE - Pre-filter logic deployed
‚úÖ ACTIVE - Liquidity scoring (0-3 points)
‚úÖ ACTIVE - Vol/Liq ratio scoring (+1 point)
```

### Expected Performance
```
Win Rate: 35-45% (current: 14.3%)
Signals/Day: 30-40 (current: ~177)
Quality: Ultra-high (30k threshold is strict)
```

---

## üìä WHAT'S DIFFERENT NOW

### Before Optimization
- Smart money bonus: +2 points (anti-predictive)
- No liquidity filtering
- Score-based only
- Win rate: 14.3%

### After Optimization
- Smart money bonus: 0 (disabled)
- $30k liquidity minimum (strict)
- Liquidity-weighted scoring
- Expected win rate: 35-45%

## üîç MONITORING COMMANDS

### Check Worker Logs
```bash
ssh root@64.227.157.221 "docker logs callsbot-worker --tail 100"
```

### Watch Liquidity Filter in Action
```bash
ssh root@64.227.157.221 "docker logs -f callsbot-worker | grep LIQUIDITY"
```

### Run Impact Analysis (after 48h)
```bash
ssh root@64.227.157.221 "cd /opt/callsbotonchain && python monitoring/liquidity_filter_impact.py"
```

### Check Container Health
```bash
ssh root@64.227.157.221 "cd /opt/callsbotonchain/deployment && docker compose ps"
```

### Check Disk Usage
```bash
ssh root@64.227.157.221 "df -h /"
```

## üéØ NEXT STEPS

### Immediate (0-24 hours)
- [ ] Monitor worker logs for liquidity filter messages
- [ ] Verify signals are being generated
- [ ] Check for any errors or warnings

### Short-term (24-48 hours)
- [ ] Run impact analysis script
- [ ] Compare signal volume to baseline
- [ ] Verify win rate is improving

### Medium-term (7 days)
- [ ] Full performance review
- [ ] Confirm 2-3x win rate improvement
- [ ] Adjust thresholds if needed

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è CONFIGURATION OPTIONS

### If Too Few Signals (<10/day)
Lower liquidity threshold:
```bash
ssh root@64.227.157.221
cd /opt/callsbotonchain/deployment
nano .env
# Change: MIN_LIQUIDITY_USD=30000 ‚Üí MIN_LIQUIDITY_USD=15000
docker compose restart worker
```

### If Too Many Losing Signals
Raise liquidity threshold:
```bash
# Change: MIN_LIQUIDITY_USD=30000 ‚Üí MIN_LIQUIDITY_USD=50000
```

### Rollback (Emergency)
Disable liquidity filter:
```bash
ssh root@64.227.157.221
cd /opt/callsbotonchain/deployment
echo "USE_LIQUIDITY_FILTER=false" >> .env
docker compose restart worker
```

## üìà SUCCESS METRICS

### After 48 Hours
- [ ] Win rate: >25% (2x improvement)
- [ ] Signals: 30-50/day
- [ ] System stable, no crashes
- [ ] Liquidity filter working (visible in logs)

### After 7 Days
- [ ] Win rate: >35% (2.5x improvement)
- [ ] Average liquidity: >$30k
- [ ] Filter blocking 80%+ of low-quality signals
- [ ] System healthy and profitable
