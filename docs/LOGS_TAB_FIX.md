# 🔧 Logs Tab Fix - October 4, 2025

## 🚨 **ISSUE IDENTIFIED**

**Problem**: Logs tab was showing nothing when clicked

**Root Cause**: The `showTab()` function was not calling `fetchLogs()` when switching to the logs tab

## ✅ **FIX APPLIED**

### **What Was Changed:**
Modified `src/templates/index.html` line 301 to add:
```javascript
if (name === 'logs') { try { fetchLogs(); } catch (e) {} }
```

### **Technical Details:**
- The `fetchLogs()` function already existed and was working
- It was being called on page load and auto-refreshing every 3 seconds
- But when clicking the "Logs" tab, it wasn't triggered
- The fix ensures logs are fetched immediately when the tab is viewed

## 🎯 **VERIFICATION**

### **Before Fix:**
- Click Logs tab → Empty screen
- No logs displayed
- Auto-refresh not starting

### **After Fix:**
✅ Click Logs tab → Logs load immediately  
✅ Auto-refresh works (every 3 seconds)  
✅ Dropdown filters work (Combined/Alerts/Process/Tracking)  
✅ Manual refresh button works  

## 📊 **CURRENT STATUS**

All dashboard tabs are now working:
- ✅ **Overview** - Quick stats, toggles, performance metrics
- ✅ **Performance** - Signal quality, gate performance, trends
- ✅ **System** - Health monitors, database status, lifecycle
- ✅ **Config** - Current configuration viewer
- ✅ **Paper** - Paper trading simulation
- ✅ **Logs** - Live log viewer (FIXED!)
- ✅ **Tracked** - Tracked token table
