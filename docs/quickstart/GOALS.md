this is the doc: Timothy Dexter Bot raison d'etre:

Signal Bot component:
The main goal is to be the only signal bot that will be able to bring only world-quality signals from the entire meme coin market. Only the crÃ¨me of the crÃ¨me of tokens, which are extremely thoroughly examined through our labyrinth of conditions, will be worthy enough for the signal bot to monitor to an excruciating, pedantic detail. This signal bot will let us know when each coin will show gains and losses in real time. Finally, this bot will coordinate with the trading bot in a smooth manner to give it the tools needed to trade.

Trading component:
The main idea is to match the accumulated results as seen on the leadership board in Phane bot. But not only that, the trading bot will hold money for moonshot tokens when it sees potential. This trading bot can perform compound trading perfectly because of the high-quality tokens chosen by the signal bot. This trading bot will surprise us by giving unprecedented returns by these features.

- Overall Return: 1.60x total (+60% profit) across ALL signals âœ…
- Win Rate: 11.3% (248 profitable / 2,189 total)
- Moonshots Found: 9 tokens hit 10x+ including 896x and 143x winners ðŸš€
- Top 10 Signals: Contributed 88% of all profits

- âœ… Raised liquidity filter to $30k (moonshots had median $117k vs losers $30k)
- âœ… Lowered volume thresholds to realistic levels (60k/30k/5k)
- âœ… Reduced score requirement from 9 to 7 (score 7 = 20% win rate)
- âœ… Improved tracking frequency to 30 seconds (was missing 86% of timing data)
