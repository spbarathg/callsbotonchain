### **🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**

#### **1. Import Path Updates**
```python
# OLD (before optimization)
from config import HIGH_CONFIDENCE_SCORE

# NEW (after optimization)  
from config.config import HIGH_CONFIDENCE_SCORE
```

#### **2. Directory Structure**
```
/opt/callsbotonchain/
├── config/                 # Configuration files
├── deployment/            # Deployment files
├── docs/                  # Documentation (organized)
├── app/                   # Core application

├── tradingSystem/         # Trading system
└── tests/                 # Test suite
```

#### **3. Docker Configuration**
- All deployment files copied to root for compatibility
- Containers using updated configuration
- No service interruptions during deployment
