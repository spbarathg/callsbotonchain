# Trading System Integration Tests

**Created:** October 21, 2025  
**Test File:** `tests/test_trading_system_integration.py`  
**Status:** ✅ ALL 23 TESTS PASSING

## Overview

Comprehensive integration tests that simulate the entire trading system flow from signal reception to position exit. These tests use **real Solana token addresses** and replicate the **exact logic** from the production trading system.

## Critical Bug Found & Fixed

### 🐛 **DEADLOCK BUG in CircuitBreaker** (CRITICAL)

**Location:** `tradingSystem/trader_optimized.py`  
**Severity:** CRITICAL - Would cause trading system to hang in production

**Problem:**
```python
def check_and_reset(self):
    with self._lock:  # Acquires lock
        # ... code ...

def record_trade(self, pnl_usd: float) -> bool:
    with self._lock:  # Acquires lock
        self.check_and_reset()  # Tries to acquire lock again -> DEADLOCK!
```

**Fix Applied:**
- Created internal `_check_and_reset_unlocked()` method that assumes lock is already held
- Public `check_and_reset()` method acquires lock and calls internal method
- `record_trade()` and `is_tripped()` now call the unlocked version

**Impact:** This bug would have caused the trading system to freeze whenever trying to record a trade, preventing all trading activity.

## Test Coverage

### 1. Token Normalization (4 tests)
Tests the critical pump.fun token address normalization logic that was causing buy failures.

- ✅ `test_valid_mint_unchanged` - Valid Solana addresses pass through
- ✅ `test_pump_suffix_stripped` - Tokens ending with "pump" are normalized
- ✅ `test_bonk_suffix_stripped` - Tokens ending with "bonk" are normalized
- ✅ `test_invalid_token_unchanged` - Invalid tokens returned as-is

**Why Critical:** The trader was receiving tokens like `ABC...XYZpump` and passing them directly to the broker, which rejected them as invalid Solana addresses.

---

### 2. Strategy Decision Logic (4 tests)
Tests the `decide_trade()` function that determines if a signal should be traded.

- ✅ `test_high_quality_signal_accepted` - Score 8+ with good stats generates trade plan
- ✅ `test_low_liquidity_rejected` - Low liquidity signals rejected
- ✅ `test_low_volume_ratio_rejected` - Low volume/mcap ratio rejected
- ✅ `test_position_sizing_by_score` - Position size varies correctly by score/conviction

**Validates:**
- Liquidity filters (MIN_LIQUIDITY_USD)
- Volume ratio filters (MIN_VOLUME_RATIO)
- Position sizing based on proven win rates
- Strategy classification (smart_money_premium, strict_premium, etc.)

---

### 3. Broker Execution (3 tests)
Tests buy/sell execution through the broker (mocked for testing).

- ✅ `test_buy_with_valid_token` - Buy succeeds with valid token
- ✅ `test_buy_with_normalized_token` - Buy works with normalized pump.fun token
- ✅ `test_sell_execution` - Sell executes and returns USD value

**Validates:**
- Fill objects returned correctly (price, qty, usd, tx, success)
- Slippage tracking
- Token address validation

---

### 4. Database Operations (4 tests)
Tests position tracking in SQLite database.

- ✅ `test_create_position` - Position creation returns valid ID
- ✅ `test_add_fills` - Buy and sell fills recorded correctly
- ✅ `test_update_peak_price` - Peak price updates only when price increases
- ✅ `test_close_position` - Position marked as closed

**Validates:**
- Position lifecycle (open → fills → close)
- Peak price tracking (never decreases)
- Quantity calculations (buys - sells)
- Thread-safe DB operations

---

### 5. Full Trading Flow (2 tests)
End-to-end tests simulating complete trades from signal to exit.

- ✅ `test_successful_trade_flow` - Complete profitable trade
  1. Receive signal with pump suffix
  2. Normalize token address
  3. Make trade decision
  4. Execute buy
  5. Create position in DB
  6. Record buy fill
  7. Simulate price increase (50% gain)
  8. Update peak price
  9. Check trailing stop (not hit yet)
  10. Simulate price drop to trailing stop
  11. Execute sell
  12. Record sell fill
  13. Close position
  14. Verify all tokens sold
  15. Calculate PnL (profitable)

- ✅ `test_stop_loss_exit` - Trade hitting stop loss
  - Entry at $0.0001
  - Stop loss at -15% ($0.000085)
  - Price drops below stop
  - Sell executes
  - Loss is ~-15% (as expected)

**Validates:**
- Complete signal-to-exit flow
- Token normalization in real workflow
- Stop loss triggers at -15%
- Trailing stop calculations
- PnL calculations
- Position cleanup

---

### 6. Circuit Breaker (3 tests)
Tests risk management circuit breaker logic.

- ✅ `test_daily_loss_limit` - Trips at 20% daily loss ($100 on $500 bankroll)
- ✅ `test_consecutive_losses_limit` - Trips after 5 consecutive losses
- ✅ `test_winning_trade_resets_consecutive` - Win resets consecutive loss counter

**Validates:**
- Daily loss limit enforcement (20% of bankroll)
- Consecutive loss limit (5 losses)
- Counter reset on winning trade
- Thread-safe lock operations
- **FIXED: Deadlock bug that would freeze trading**

---

### 7. Edge Cases (3 tests)
Tests error conditions and edge cases.

- ✅ `test_zero_quantity_position` - Handles zero quantity positions
- ✅ `test_missing_stats_fields` - Handles missing stats gracefully
- ✅ `test_negative_price_update` - Negative prices handled correctly

**Validates:**
- Robustness to bad data
- Graceful degradation
- No crashes on edge cases

## Key Insights from Testing

### 1. Token Normalization is Critical
The tests confirmed that pump.fun tokens come with suffixes (e.g., `ABC...XYZpump`) that must be stripped before passing to the broker. The normalization logic:
- Checks if token ends with known suffixes ("pump", "bonk")
- Strips the suffix
- Validates the result is a valid 32-byte Solana address
- Returns normalized address or original if invalid

### 2. Circuit Breaker Had Deadlock Bug
The tests revealed a critical deadlock in the `CircuitBreaker` class that would have frozen the trading system in production. The bug was in the lock acquisition pattern where `record_trade()` acquired a lock and then called `check_and_reset()` which tried to acquire the same lock.

### 3. Stop Loss Calculations are Correct
Tests confirmed that stop loss is calculated from **entry price** (not peak price), which is the correct behavior. This ensures losses are limited to -15% regardless of how high the price goes.

### 4. Trailing Stop Protects Gains
Tests validated that trailing stop is calculated from **peak price**, allowing winners to run while protecting gains. The trailing stop follows the price up but never down.

### 5. Database Operations are Thread-Safe
All database operations use WAL mode and proper locking, ensuring thread-safe position tracking even with concurrent access.

## Next Steps

### 1. Deploy Circuit Breaker Fix to Server
```bash
# Copy fixed file to server
scp tradingSystem/trader_optimized.py root@64.227.157.221:/opt/callsbotonchain/tradingSystem/

# Restart trader container
ssh root@64.227.157.221 "cd /opt/callsbotonchain/deployment && docker compose restart callsbot-trader"
```

### 2. Monitor for Deadlocks
After deploying, monitor trader logs for any hanging behavior:
```bash
ssh root@64.227.157.221 "docker logs --since 10m callsbot-trader | grep -E 'record_trade|circuit|breaker'"
```

### 3. Add More Tests (Future)
- Test with real Jupiter API (integration test)
- Test with real Redis signals (integration test)
- Test portfolio rebalancing logic
- Test circle strategy
- Test adaptive trailing stops
