## 🎰 THE WINNING STRATEGY: "Shotgun + Sniper" Approach

### Core Principle
**Cast a wide net to find rockets, then ride them to the moon.**

### Strategy Components

#### 1️⃣ **SHOTGUN PHASE: Find the Winners**
**Goal:** Trade volume to statistically catch big winners

- **Allocation:** 60% of capital ($300 initially)
- **Position Size:** $3-5 per signal
- **Target:** 60-100 signals per day
- **Entry:** Within 1-5 minutes of signal
- **Exit Strategy:**
  - Take 50% profit at 2x
  - Take 25% profit at 3x  
  - Let 25% run with 30% trailing stop
- **Stop Loss:** -40% or 2-hour time stop (if no movement)

**Logic:** With 100 signals at 1.3% odds of 10x+, you have ~73% chance of catching at least one big winner.

#### 2️⃣ **SNIPER PHASE: Scale Winners**
**Goal:** Identify early winners and add to position

- **Allocation:** 40% of capital ($200 initially) - RESERVED
- **Trigger:** When a shotgun position hits 1.5x within first 30 minutes
- **Action:** Add 2x-3x the original position size
- **Exit Strategy:**
  - Take 30% at 3x
  - Take 30% at 5x
  - Let 40% run with 25% trailing stop from peak

**Logic:** Early momentum = potential rocket. Scale into winners, not losers.

## 📈 TAKE-PROFIT LADDER (Critical for Success!)

### For ALL Positions
Based on your entry price:

| Target | Action | Reasoning |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| **1.3x** | Watch closely | Starting to move |
| **1.5x** | Consider sniper add | Early momentum |
| **2x** | Take 50% profit | Secure break-even |
| **3x** | Take 25% profit | Lock gains |
| **5x** | Take 15% profit | Exceptional winner |
| **10x+** | Trail with 25% stop | Let it moon |

### Special Rule: "The Moon or Bust"
If a position hits **5x within 1 hour:**

## 🎯 EXECUTION RULES

### Entry (CRITICAL!)

## 🎓 TRADING PSYCHOLOGY

### Mindset Rules
1. **Think in Probabilities:** You will lose on 65% of trades. That's OK.
2. **Obsess Over Process:** Good process = good results over time
3. **Detach from Outcomes:** Any single trade doesn't matter
4. **Compound Patience:** Each 2x is a milestone, not a finish line
5. **Celebrate Wins:** But stay humble and hungry

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- ❌ Trading all 700 signals (impossible and inefficient)
- ❌ Not taking profits (greed kills gains)
- ❌ Chasing pumps (FOMO = losses)
- ❌ Holding losers (hope is not a strategy)
- ❌ Equal position sizes (smart sizing = better returns)
- ❌ No stop losses (one -90% can kill 10 wins)
