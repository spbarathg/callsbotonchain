# 🔧 RESTORATION GUIDE - V4 Moonshot Hunter (38% Win Rate)

**Date:** October 21, 2025  
**Purpose:** Step-by-step guide to restore this exact configuration  
**Performance:** 38% win rate (2x+ gains) in 1 day

---

## 🎯 WHEN TO USE THIS GUIDE

Use this restoration guide if:
- ✅ System performance has degraded (<30% win rate for 7+ days)
- ✅ Configuration was changed and needs to be reverted
- ✅ New deployment requires baseline configuration
- ✅ Testing showed worse results than this snapshot

**This configuration is your safety net!**

---

## 📋 PRE-RESTORATION CHECKLIST

Before restoring, ensure you have:

- [ ] **Backup of current configuration** (in case you need to revert)
- [ ] **Access to server** (SSH credentials)
- [ ] **Docker access** (ability to restart containers)
- [ ] **This snapshot folder** (all reference documents)
- [ ] **30 minutes of downtime** (for safe restoration)

---

## 🔧 RESTORATION STEPS

### **Step 1: Backup Current Configuration**

```bash
# SSH into server
ssh root@64.227.157.221

# Create backup directory
mkdir -p /opt/callsbotonchain/backups/$(date +%Y-%m-%d-%H%M%S)

# Backup current files
cd /opt/callsbotonchain
cp deployment/.env backups/$(date +%Y-%m-%d-%H%M%S)/.env
cp deployment/docker-compose.yml backups/$(date +%Y-%m-%d-%H%M%S)/docker-compose.yml
cp app/config_unified.py backups/$(date +%Y-%m-%d-%H%M%S)/config_unified.py
cp app/analyze_token.py backups/$(date +%Y-%m-%d-%H%M%S)/analyze_token.py
cp app/signal_processor.py backups/$(date +%Y-%m-%d-%H%M%S)/signal_processor.py

echo "✅ Backup complete!"
```

---

### **Step 2: Update Environment Variables**

Edit `deployment/.env`:

```bash
cd /opt/callsbotonchain/deployment
nano .env
```

**Set these CRITICAL values:**

```bash
# Market Cap Range (CRITICAL!)
MIN_MARKET_CAP_USD=10000
MAX_MARKET_CAP_USD=500000

# Liquidity Filter (CRITICAL!)
USE_LIQUIDITY_FILTER=false
MIN_LIQUIDITY_USD=0

# Score Threshold (CRITICAL!)
GENERAL_CYCLE_MIN_SCORE=7  # or 8 (verify which was used)
SMART_CYCLE_MIN_SCORE=7

# Volume
MIN_VOLUME_24H_USD=10000
MIN_VOL_TO_MCAP_RATIO=0.3

# Holder Concentration
MAX_TOP10_CONCENTRATION=30
MAX_BUNDLERS_CONCENTRATION=15
MAX_INSIDERS_CONCENTRATION=25

# Smart Money (CRITICAL!)
SMART_MONEY_SCORE_BONUS=0
REQUIRE_SMART_MONEY_FOR_ALERT=false

# Telethon
ENABLE_TELETHON_NOTIFICATIONS=true
TELETHON_SESSION_FILE=/app/var/relay_user.session

# Trader (Match worker liquidity filter)
TS_MIN_LIQUIDITY_USD=0
```

Save and exit (`Ctrl+X`, `Y`, `Enter`)

---

### **Step 3: Verify Code Files**

**Check `app/config_unified.py`:**

```bash
cd /opt/callsbotonchain

# Verify smart money bonus is 0
grep "SMART_MONEY_SCORE_BONUS" app/config_unified.py
# Should show: SMART_MONEY_SCORE_BONUS = _get_int("SMART_MONEY_SCORE_BONUS", 0)

# Verify score threshold enforcement
grep "GENERAL_CYCLE_MIN_SCORE" app/config_unified.py
# Should show: GENERAL_CYCLE_MIN_SCORE = _get_int("GENERAL_CYCLE_MIN_SCORE", 7)
```

**Check `app/signal_processor.py`:**

```bash
# Verify score threshold is enforced
grep -A5 "Score Below Threshold" app/signal_processor.py
# Should show rejection logic for score < GENERAL_CYCLE_MIN_SCORE
```

**Check `app/analyze_token.py`:**

```bash
# Verify smart money bonus is removed
grep -A2 "if smart_money_detected:" app/analyze_token.py | head -5
# Should NOT show score += 2 or score += 3
# Should show: scoring_details.append("Smart Money: detected (no bonus)")
```

**If any checks fail, restore from this snapshot's code references!**

---

### **Step 4: Restart Containers**

```bash
cd /opt/callsbotonchain/deployment

# Stop all containers
docker compose down

# Rebuild (to pick up any code changes)
docker compose build --no-cache

# Start containers
docker compose up -d

# Verify all containers are running
docker ps --format '{{.Names}}: {{.Status}}'
```

**Expected output:**
```
callsbot-worker: Up X seconds (healthy)
callsbot-signal-aggregator: Up X seconds (healthy)
callsbot-redis: Up X seconds (healthy)
callsbot-trader: Up X seconds (healthy)
```

---

### **Step 5: Verify Configuration Runtime**

**Check environment variables in worker:**

```bash
# Market cap
docker exec callsbot-worker printenv MIN_MARKET_CAP_USD
# Expected: 10000

docker exec callsbot-worker printenv MAX_MARKET_CAP_USD
# Expected: 500000

# Liquidity filter
docker exec callsbot-worker printenv USE_LIQUIDITY_FILTER
# Expected: false

docker exec callsbot-worker printenv MIN_LIQUIDITY_USD
# Expected: 0

# Score threshold
docker exec callsbot-worker printenv GENERAL_CYCLE_MIN_SCORE
# Expected: 7 or 8
```

**Check trader liquidity filter:**

```bash
docker exec callsbot-trader printenv TS_MIN_LIQUIDITY_USD
# Expected: 0
```

**If any values are wrong, fix `.env` and restart containers!**

---

### **Step 6: Monitor First Signals**

**Watch logs for 10 minutes:**

```bash
# Watch worker logs
docker logs -f callsbot-worker

# Look for these patterns:
# ✅ "MARKET CAP SWEET SPOT" messages
# ✅ "REJECTED (Score Below Threshold)" for score <7
# ✅ "telegram_ok=True" for signals
# ❌ NO "database is locked" errors
# ❌ NO "event loop must not change" errors
```

**Expected behavior:**
- Tokens <$10k: REJECTED (MARKET CAP TOO LOW)
- Tokens >$500k: REJECTED (MARKET CAP TOO HIGH)
- Tokens with score <7: REJECTED (Score Below Threshold)
- Tokens with score 7+: Proceed to detailed analysis
- Smart money detection: NO bypass of score check

---

### **Step 7: Verify Signal Quality**

**Check recent signals:**

```bash
docker exec callsbot-worker sqlite3 var/alerted_tokens.db "
SELECT 
    datetime(alerted_at, 'unixepoch', 'localtime') as time,
    substr(token_address,1,12) as token,
    final_score as score
FROM alerted_tokens 
WHERE alerted_at > (strftime('%s', 'now') - 3600) 
ORDER BY alerted_at DESC 
LIMIT 10
"
```

**Expected:**
- All signals have score ≥7
- 0-3 signals per hour (quality over quantity)
- No signals with score <7

**If any signals have score <7, score threshold is NOT enforced!**

---

### **Step 8: Run 24-Hour Validation**

**Monitor for 24 hours and check:**

```bash
# Signal volume
docker exec callsbot-worker sqlite3 var/alerted_tokens.db "
SELECT COUNT(*) as signals_24h
FROM alerted_tokens 
WHERE alerted_at > (strftime('%s', 'now') - 86400)
"
# Expected: 10-30 signals

# Score distribution
docker logs --since 24h callsbot-worker | grep -oP 'score.*?/10' | sort | uniq -c
# Expected: Mostly score 7-10, no score <7

# Telegram delivery
docker logs --since 24h callsbot-worker | grep "telegram_ok=True" | wc -l
# Expected: Should match signal count (100% delivery)

# Database locks
docker logs --since 24h callsbot-worker callsbot-signal-aggregator | grep -c "database is locked"
# Expected: 0
```

---

---

## 🚨 TROUBLESHOOTING

### **Problem: Score <7 signals appearing**

**Cause:** Score threshold not enforced

**Fix:**
```bash
# Check signal_processor.py
grep -A10 "Score Below Threshold" app/signal_processor.py

# Should show:
# if score < GENERAL_CYCLE_MIN_SCORE:
#     REJECT

# If missing, restore from snapshot
# Then rebuild and restart containers
```

---

### **Problem: Liquidity filter rejecting signals**

**Cause:** Liquidity filter not disabled

**Fix:**
```bash
# Check environment variable
docker exec callsbot-worker printenv USE_LIQUIDITY_FILTER
# Should be: false

# If not, fix .env and restart:
cd /opt/callsbotonchain/deployment
nano .env
# Set: USE_LIQUIDITY_FILTER=false
docker compose restart callsbot-worker
```

---

### **Problem: Smart money bypassing score check**

**Cause:** Old code with smart money bypass logic

**Fix:**
```bash
# Check signal_processor.py
grep -B5 -A5 "smart_money" app/signal_processor.py | grep -A5 "GENERAL_CYCLE_MIN_SCORE"

# Should show score check BEFORE any smart money logic
# If smart money bypasses score check, restore code from snapshot
```

---

### **Problem: Telegram notifications failing**

**Cause:** Event loop issue or session file problem

**Fix:**
```bash
# Check Telethon errors
docker logs --tail 100 callsbot-worker | grep -i telethon

# If "event loop must not change" error:
# Restore app/telethon_notifier.py from snapshot
# (Fresh client + event loop for each message)

# If "Session not authorized" error:
# Re-authorize session:
docker exec -it callsbot-worker python scripts/setup_telethon_session.py
```

---

### **Problem: Too many signals (>50/day)**

**Cause:** Score threshold too low or not enforced

**Fix:**
```bash
# Increase score threshold
cd /opt/callsbotonchain/deployment
nano .env
# Set: GENERAL_CYCLE_MIN_SCORE=8 (instead of 7)
docker compose restart callsbot-worker
```

---

### **Problem: Too few signals (<5/day)**

**Cause:** Filters too strict or market slow

**Fix:**
```bash
# Check market cap range
docker exec callsbot-worker printenv MIN_MARKET_CAP_USD
docker exec callsbot-worker printenv MAX_MARKET_CAP_USD
# Should be: 10000 and 500000

# Check score threshold
docker exec callsbot-worker printenv GENERAL_CYCLE_MIN_SCORE
# Should be: 7 (not 8)

# If values correct, market may be slow (normal)
```
