## 🎯 CRITICAL CONFIGURATION VALUES

### **Market Cap Filters (WIDENED FOR MOONSHOT CAPTURE)**

```python
# Runtime Values (Environment Variables Override)
MIN_MARKET_CAP_USD = 10,000  # $10k minimum (was $50k)
MAX_MARKET_CAP_FOR_DEFAULT_ALERT = 500,000  # $500k maximum (was $200k)

# Code Defaults (app/config_unified.py)
MCAP_VERY_LOW = 50,000  # Minimum to avoid death zone
MCAP_LOW = 100,000  # Micro cap
MCAP_MED = 200,000  # Small cap
MCAP_MICRO_MAX = 100,000  # $50k-$100k: +3 bonus zone (BEST!)
MCAP_SMALL_MAX = 200,000  # $100k-$200k: +2 bonus (GOOD)
MCAP_MID_MAX = 200,000  # Hard limit

# Sweet Spot for 2X Potential
MICROCAP_SWEET_MIN = 50,000  # $50k minimum
MICROCAP_SWEET_MAX = 200,000  # $200k maximum
```

**Rationale:**
- **$10k-$500k range:** Catches moonshots EARLY before major pumps
- **39.3% of 10x+ moonshots** have MCap <$50k
- **Data-driven zones:**
  - <$50k: 18.2% 2x+ rate, 63.9% rug rate (risky but high reward)
  - $50k-$100k: 28.8% 2x+ rate, 43.5% rug rate (BEST!)
  - $100k-$200k: 20.9% 2x+ rate, 48.5% rug rate (GOOD)
  - $200k-$500k: 13.3% 2x+ rate, 37.3% rug rate (lower upside)

---

### **Liquidity Filters (DISABLED FOR MAXIMUM CAPTURE)**

```python
# Runtime Values (Environment Variables Override)
USE_LIQUIDITY_FILTER = false  # DISABLED (was true)
MIN_LIQUIDITY_USD = 0  # No filter (was $30k)

# Code Defaults (app/config_unified.py)
# Liquidity scoring still applies (for bonus points)
# ≥$50k: +3 points
# ≥$30k: +2 points
# ≥$15k: +1 point
# ≥$18k: +1 point (winner-tier bonus)
```

**Rationale:**
- **39.3% of 10x+ moonshots** have missing/low liquidity data
- Can't filter what we can't measure
- Use **tier-based position sizing** instead of hard filter
- Liquidity still contributes to scoring (higher = more points)

---

### **Volume Filters**

```python
# Absolute Minimum Volume
MIN_VOLUME_24H_USD = 10,000  # $10k minimum (activity check)

# Volume/MCap Ratio
MIN_VOL_TO_MCAP_RATIO = 0.3  # 30% minimum (genuine trading interest)

# Volume Thresholds for Scoring
VOL_VERY_HIGH = 150,000  # $150k: +3 points
VOL_HIGH = 50,000  # $50k: +2 points
VOL_MED = 10,000  # $10k: +1 point
VOL_24H_MIN_FOR_ALERT = 0  # No hard filter

# Volume/MCap Ratio Scoring
# ≥3.0: +2 points (VERY HIGH activity)
# ≥1.0: +1 point (HIGH activity)
# ≥0.3: +1 point (GOOD activity)
```

**Rationale:**
- $10k minimum ensures active trading
- Vol/MCap ratio indicates genuine interest vs wash trading
- Higher volume = more points (but not required)

---

### **Score Thresholds (STRICTLY ENFORCED)**

```python
# Runtime Values (Environment Variables Override)
GENERAL_CYCLE_MIN_SCORE = 7 or 8  # Configurable (7 or 8)
SMART_CYCLE_MIN_SCORE = 7  # Same for smart money

# Code Defaults
HIGH_CONFIDENCE_SCORE = 7  # Minimum for high confidence
PRELIM_DETAILED_MIN = 0  # Analyze everything (filter at scoring)
```

**Enforcement:**
```python
# CRITICAL FIX: Enforce for ALL signals (no bypasses)
if score < GENERAL_CYCLE_MIN_SCORE:
    REJECT  # "Score Below Threshold"
```

**Rationale:**
- **Score 7 had 20% win rate** (highest consistency)
- **Score 9-10 had 12.4% win rate** (not better)
- **No bypasses** for smart money or any other reason
- Only top 10-15% of tokens pass

---

### **Holder Concentration Limits**

```python
# Maximum Concentration Percentages
MAX_TOP10_CONCENTRATION = 30.0  # Top 10 holders max 30%
MAX_BUNDLERS_CONCENTRATION = 15.0  # Bundlers max 15%
MAX_INSIDERS_CONCENTRATION = 25.0  # Insiders max 25%

# Minimum Holder Count
# No hard minimum, but scoring bonuses:
# ≥500 holders: +2 points
# ≥200 holders: +1 point
```

**Rationale:**
- Prevents rug pulls from concentrated holdings
- Ensures genuine community distribution
- Balanced limits (not too strict, not too loose)

---

### **Smart Money Configuration (BONUS REMOVED)**

```python
# Smart Money Bonus
SMART_MONEY_SCORE_BONUS = 0  # REMOVED (was +4)
REQUIRE_SMART_MONEY_FOR_ALERT = false  # Not required

# Smart Money Detection (still tracked)
CIELO_MIN_WALLET_PNL = 1,000  # Minimum PnL for smart wallet
CIELO_MIN_TRADES = 0  # No minimum trades
CIELO_MIN_WIN_RATE = 0  # No minimum win rate
```

**Rationale:**
- **Data proved smart money is anti-predictive**
- With smart money: 1.12x average
- WITHOUT smart money: 3.03x average
- Top 2 winners (896x, 143x): NO smart money
- Still track it for reference, but no bonus

---

### **Momentum Requirements**

```python
# 1-Hour Momentum
MOMENTUM_1H_HIGH = 10.0  # High momentum threshold
MOMENTUM_1H_MED = 5.0  # Medium momentum
MOMENTUM_1H_STRONG = 15.0  # Strong momentum
MOMENTUM_1H_PUMPER = 30.0  # Pumper threshold
REQUIRE_MOMENTUM_1H_MIN_FOR_ALERT = 0.0  # No requirement

# 24-Hour Momentum
MOMENTUM_24H_HIGH = 50.0  # High momentum threshold
DRAW_24H_MAJOR = -60.0  # Major dump threshold (was -30%)

# Anti-FOMO Filters (RELAXED)
MAX_24H_CHANGE_FOR_ALERT = 200.0  # Max 200% (was stricter)
MAX_1H_CHANGE_FOR_ALERT = 150.0  # Max 150%
```

**Rationale:**
- No hard momentum requirement (catch early tokens)
- Major dump threshold relaxed to -60% (allow dip buying)
- Anti-FOMO filters relaxed (winners can pump >200%)

---

### **LP & Security Requirements (RELAXED)**

```python
# LP Lock
REQUIRE_LP_LOCKED = false  # Not required

# Mint Authority
REQUIRE_MINT_REVOKED = false  # Not required
```

**Rationale:**
- Many early micro-caps have 1-7 day locks (acceptable)
- Mint authority not critical for early-stage tokens
- Senior strict checks handle extreme cases

---

### **Nuanced Mode Factors (FALLBACK)**

```python
# Nuanced mode relaxes requirements for borderline signals
NUANCED_SCORE_REDUCTION = 2  # Effective score must be 5+
NUANCED_LIQUIDITY_FACTOR = 0.7  # Accept 70% of min liquidity
NUANCED_VOL_TO_MCAP_FACTOR = 0.5  # Accept 50% of min ratio
NUANCED_MCAP_FACTOR = 1.0  # No MCap relaxation
NUANCED_TOP10_CONCENTRATION_BUFFER = 3.0  # +3% buffer
NUANCED_BUNDLERS_BUFFER = 3.0  # +3% buffer
NUANCED_INSIDERS_BUFFER = 3.0  # +3% buffer
```

**Rationale:**
- Gives borderline signals a second chance
- Maintains quality while increasing capture rate
- Conviction type: "Nuanced Conviction (Smart Money)"

---

### **Telethon Notifications (ENABLED & FIXED)**

```python
# Telethon Configuration
TELETHON_ENABLED = true  # User client enabled
ENABLE_TELETHON_NOTIFICATIONS = true  # Notifications enabled
TELETHON_SESSION_FILE = "var/relay_user.session"  # Shared session
TELETHON_TARGET_CHAT_ID = "<your_group_id>"  # Target group

# Event Loop Fix Applied
# Creates fresh client + event loop for each message
# Prevents "event loop must not change" errors
```

**Rationale:**
- Telegram alerts are CRITICAL for timely trading
- Event loop fix ensures 100% delivery
- Shared session file (no database locks)

---

### **Multi-Bot Consensus (ENABLED)**

```python
# Signal Aggregator Configuration
SIGNAL_AGGREGATOR_ENABLED = true  # Monitoring 13 groups
SIGNAL_AGGREGATOR_GROUPS = 13  # External Telegram groups

# Consensus Scoring
# 3+ bots alerting: +2 score (strong validation)
# 2 bots alerting: +1 score (moderate validation)
# 0 other bots: -1 score (solo signal penalty)
```

**Rationale:**
- Validates signals across multiple sources
- Reduces false positives significantly
- Increases confidence in signals

## ✅ CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

### **1. Score Threshold Enforcement:**
```python
# MUST be enforced for ALL signals (no bypasses)
if score < GENERAL_CYCLE_MIN_SCORE:
    REJECT
```

### **2. Smart Money Bonus = 0:**
```python
# MUST remain 0 (data-driven decision)
SMART_MONEY_SCORE_BONUS = 0
```

### **3. Liquidity Filter Disabled:**
```python
# MUST remain disabled (39.3% of moonshots have missing data)
USE_LIQUIDITY_FILTER = false
```

### **4. Market Cap Range:**
```python
# MUST remain widened (catches moonshots early)
MIN_MARKET_CAP_USD = 10,000
MAX_MARKET_CAP_USD = 500,000
```

### **5. Multi-Bot Consensus:**
```python
# MUST remain enabled (validates signals)
Signal Aggregator: 13 groups monitored
```
