## üöÄ QUICK REFERENCE

### **Key Configuration Values:**

```yaml
# Market Cap Range
MIN_MARKET_CAP_USD: 10,000
MAX_MARKET_CAP_USD: 500,000

# Liquidity Filter (DISABLED)
USE_LIQUIDITY_FILTER: false
MIN_LIQUIDITY_USD: 0

# Score Threshold (STRICTLY ENFORCED)
GENERAL_CYCLE_MIN_SCORE: 7 or 8
SMART_CYCLE_MIN_SCORE: 7

# Volume Requirements
MIN_VOLUME_24H_USD: 10,000
MIN_VOL_TO_MCAP_RATIO: 0.3

# Holder Concentration Limits
MAX_TOP10_CONCENTRATION: 30%
MAX_BUNDLERS_CONCENTRATION: 15%
MAX_INSIDERS_CONCENTRATION: 25%

# Smart Money (NO BONUS)
SMART_MONEY_SCORE_BONUS: 0

# Multi-Bot Consensus (ENABLED)
Signal Aggregator: 13 groups monitored
Consensus Bonus: +2 for 3+ bots
```

### **Critical Success Factors:**

1. ‚úÖ **Score threshold strictly enforced** (no bypasses)
2. ‚úÖ **Smart money bonus removed** (0 points)
3. ‚úÖ **Liquidity filter disabled** (39.3% of moonshots have missing data)
4. ‚úÖ **Market cap widened** ($10k-$500k for early detection)
5. ‚úÖ **Multi-bot consensus** (validates signals across 13 groups)
6. ‚úÖ **Data-driven scoring** (based on 2,189 signal analysis)

---

## üìà WHY THIS CONFIGURATION WORKS

### **1. Data-Driven Thresholds**
Every threshold was chosen based on analysis of 2,189 real signals:
- Market cap scoring: Based on 7-day performance analysis
- Liquidity requirements: Based on winner vs loser medians
- Score threshold: Based on consistency analysis (Score 7 = 20% WR)

### **2. Bias Removal**
Removed anti-productive biases:
- Smart money bonus: 0 (non-smart outperformed 3.03x vs 1.12x)
- FOMO penalty: Removed (winners can pump >200%)
- LP lock penalty: Removed (not required)
- Concentration penalty: Relaxed (too strict)

### **3. Early Detection**
Catches tokens before major pumps:
- $10k-$500k range (moonshot zone)
- Micro-cap optimized thresholds
- Preliminary scoring lowered 80%

### **4. Quality Over Quantity**
Very selective filtering:
- 7-step process
- 1-3% pass rate
- Only Score 7+ signals

### **5. Consensus Validation**
Multi-bot signal aggregation:
- 13 external groups monitored
- +2 score bonus for 3+ bot consensus
- Reduces false positives

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: DO NOT CHANGE WITHOUT TESTING

This configuration achieved **38% win rate** through extensive optimization. Any changes should be:

1. ‚úÖ **Backed by data** (analyze at least 100+ signals)
2. ‚úÖ **Tested in paper trading** (validate for 7+ days)
3. ‚úÖ **Compared to this baseline** (use this snapshot as reference)
4. ‚úÖ **Documented thoroughly** (create new snapshot if better)

**If in doubt, restore this configuration!**

## üìö HOW TO USE THIS SNAPSHOT

### **For Reference:**
- Read `config_snapshot.md` for exact values
- Read `scoring_system.md` for algorithm details
- Read `filtering_gates.md` for all checks

### **For Restoration:**
- Follow `restoration_guide.md` step-by-step
- Verify with `monitoring_checklist.md`
- Compare performance to `backtest_results.md`

### **For Optimization:**
- Review `data_driven_optimizations.md` for rationale
- Use `comparison_to_previous.md` for context
- Create new snapshot if improvements validated

## üéØ SYSTEM HEALTH INDICATORS

### **Good Signs (System Working):**
```
‚úÖ 10-30 signals per day
‚úÖ 100% of signals are Score 7+
‚úÖ 1-3% pass rate (selective)
‚úÖ telegram_ok=True for all signals
‚úÖ Multi-bot consensus active
‚úÖ Zero database locks
‚úÖ All containers healthy
```

### **Warning Signs (Needs Attention):**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è <5 signals per day (filters too strict)
‚ö†Ô∏è >50 signals per day (filters too loose)
‚ö†Ô∏è Signals with score <7 (threshold not enforced)
‚ö†Ô∏è telegram_ok=False (notifications broken)
‚ö†Ô∏è Win rate <30% for 3+ days (quality issue)
```
