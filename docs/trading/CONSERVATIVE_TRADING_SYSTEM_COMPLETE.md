> "can you ensure the built trading system facilitates all of this"

Referring to the conservative capital management strategy with:
- Small position sizes (5-12%)
- 50% cash reserve
- Daily/Weekly loss limits
- Risk-tier based sizing
- Capital preservation first

---

## ✅ What Was Built

### 1. **Risk Tier Integration** (`app/risk_tiers.py` - Already Created Earlier)

Classifies signals into 3 risk tiers based on market cap, score, liquidity, volume:

- **TIER 1 (MOONSHOT)**: $10k-$50k MCap → 5-8% position, -70% stop, 5x-100x+ target
- **TIER 2 (AGGRESSIVE)**: $50k-$150k MCap → 8-12% position, -50% stop, 2x-20x target
- **TIER 3 (CALCULATED)**: $150k-$500k MCap → 5-8% position, -40% stop, 2x-5x target

---

### 2. **Conservative Configuration** (`tradingSystem/config_conservative.py` - NEW)

Implements ALL your requirements:

```python
# Position Sizing
TIER1_DEFAULT_PCT = 7.0    # Moonshot: 7%
TIER2_DEFAULT_PCT = 10.0   # Aggressive: 10%
TIER3_DEFAULT_PCT = 6.0    # Calculated: 6%
MAX_POSITION_SIZE_PCT = 12.0  # ABSOLUTE MAX

# Portfolio Limits
MAX_CONCURRENT = 6         # Max 4-6 positions
MAX_CAPITAL_DEPLOYED_PCT = 50.0    # Never exceed 50%!
MIN_CASH_RESERVE_PCT = 50.0        # Always keep 50%

# Circuit Breakers
MAX_DAILY_LOSS_PCT = 10.0   # -10% daily → STOP
MAX_WEEKLY_LOSS_PCT = 20.0  # -20% weekly → STOP
MAX_CONSECUTIVE_LOSSES = 3  # 3 losses → Recovery mode

# Stop Losses (by tier)
TIER1_STOP_LOSS_PCT = 70.0  # -70% for moonshots
TIER2_STOP_LOSS_PCT = 50.0  # -50% for aggressive
TIER3_STOP_LOSS_PCT = 40.0  # -40% for calculated

# Trailing Stops (by tier)
TIER1_TRAIL_PCT = 50.0      # Wide for moonshots
TIER2_TRAIL_PCT = 35.0      # Medium
TIER3_TRAIL_PCT = 25.0      # Tight for quick flips
```

**Key Functions:**
- `get_position_size_conservative()` - Calculates position size with tier classification
- `check_can_trade()` - Enforces daily/weekly loss limits
- `get_stop_loss_for_tier()` - Returns stop loss % for tier
- `get_trailing_stop_for_tier()` - Returns trailing stop % for tier

## 💡 How It Works

### Example: Opening a Position

```python
from tradingSystem.paper_trader_conservative import ConservativePaperTrader

# Initialize
trader = ConservativePaperTrader(starting_capital=1000)

# Your bot generates a signal
signal_data = {
    'token_address': 'ABC123...',
    'price': 0.00001,
    'first_market_cap_usd': 75000,  # Tier 2 (Aggressive)
    'liquidity_usd': 35000,
    'volume_24h_usd': 50000,
    'final_score': 8,
    'conviction_type': 'High Confidence'
}

# System automatically:
# 1. Classifies as TIER 2 (Aggressive)
# 2. Calculates position size: 10% = $100
# 3. Checks cash reserve: 50% min maintained ✅
# 4. Checks circuit breaker: Not tripped ✅
# 5. Checks deployment: Under 50% ✅
# 6. Opens position!

pos_id = trader.open_position('ABC123...', signal_data)
```

### Example: Circuit Breaker in Action

```
Starting capital: $1,000

Trade 1: -$50 (5% loss) → OK (daily: -$50)
Trade 2: -$40 (4% loss) → OK (daily: -$90)
Trade 3: -$20 (2% loss) → 🚨 CIRCUIT BREAKER TRIPPED!
                          Daily loss: -$110 (>-$100 limit)
                          → NO MORE TRADES TODAY

Next day: Counter resets, can trade again
          But recovery mode active → positions cut by 50%

Next trade: Win +$80 → Recovery mode OFF ✅
```

---

## 📊 What It Enforces

### Capital Preservation ✅

```
Example Portfolio at $1,000:

Cash Reserve:   $550 (55%)  ✅ > 50% minimum
Deployed:       $390 (39%)  ✅ < 50% maximum

Position 1:     $70  (7%)   ✅ Tier 1 in range (5-8%)
Position 2:     $100 (10%)  ✅ Tier 2 in range (8-12%)
Position 3:     $100 (10%)  ✅ Tier 2 in range (8-12%)
Position 4:     $60  (6%)   ✅ Tier 3 in range (5-8%)
Position 5:     $60  (6%)   ✅ Tier 3 in range (5-8%)

Total: 5 positions ✅ < 6 maximum
Max loss if ALL stop: -$180 (18%) ✅ Manageable
```

### Loss Limits ✅

- **Daily**: Auto-stops at -10% ($100 loss on $1,000)
- **Weekly**: Auto-stops at -20% ($200 loss on $1,000)
- **Consecutive**: Enters recovery mode after 3 losses

### Position Sizing ✅

- **Tier 1**: 5-8% (small bets on moonshots)
- **Tier 2**: 8-12% (bread and butter)
- **Tier 3**: 5-8% (quick flips)
- **ABSOLUTE MAX**: 12% per position (never exceeded!)
