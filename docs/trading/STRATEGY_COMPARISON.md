## Key Differences Explained

### Position Sizing

**Conservative:** Protects capital first
```
$1,000 capital:
- Tier 1: $70 (7%)   - Max loss: $49 (4.9%)
- Tier 2: $100 (10%) - Max loss: $50 (5%)
- Tier 3: $60 (6%)   - Max loss: $24 (2.4%)

5 positions = $390 deployed (39%)
Max total loss if ALL stop: $180 (18%)
```

**1-Week 3x:** Aggressive for moonshots
```
$1,000 capital:
- Tier 1: $120 (12%) - Max loss: $84 (8.4%)
- Tier 2: $150 (15%) - Max loss: $75 (7.5%)
- Tier 3: $80 (8%)   - Max loss: $32 (3.2%)

6 positions = $700 deployed (70%)
Max total loss if ALL stop: $350 (35%)
```

**Why Larger?** To hit 3x in 1 week, you need bigger moonshot positions. A $70 position at 30x = $2,100 gain. A $120 position at 30x = $3,600 gain (already 3x!)

---

### Deployment Limits

**Conservative:** 50% max deployed
- Always keeps 50% cash
- Protects against black swan events
- Can always re-enter
- Slower growth but safe

**1-Week 3x:** 70% max deployed
- More capital working for you
- Higher exposure to moonshots
- Riskier but necessary for 3x goal
- Must hit goal before black swan

---

### Loss Limits

**Conservative:**
- Daily: -10% ‚Üí STOP (tight control)
- Weekly: -20% ‚Üí STOP
- After 3 losses: Cut positions 50%

**1-Week 3x:**
- Daily: -15% ‚Üí STOP (more breathing room)
- Weekly: -30% ‚Üí STOP
- After 5 losses: Cut positions 30%

**Why Relaxed?** Moonshot hunting involves more losses before hitting the big winner. Tighter limits would stop you prematurely.

## Example Scenarios

### Conservative Approach (Week 1 of 30 days)

```
Day 1-7 (Week 1):
- 12 signals taken (1-2 per day)
- 3 winners (25% WR): +$450
- 9 losers: -$200
- Week profit: +$250
- Capital: $1,250 (25% gain)

Continue steady for 30 days ‚Üí $3,500-$4,500
```

---

### 1-Week 3x Approach (Entire Week)

```
Day 1-7 (All In):
- 30 signals taken (3-5 per day)
- Hit ONE 20x moonshot: +$2,280 (on $120 position)
- 8 medium winners (3-5x): +$1,500
- 21 losers: -$950
- Week profit: +$2,830
- Capital: $3,830 (283% gain) ‚úÖ GOAL HIT!
```

**Key:** Aggressive approach takes 2.5x more signals and needs 1-2 big moonshots.

---

## Moonshot Requirements

### Conservative (30 Days):
- **Moonshots needed:** 2-4 over 30 days
- **Average multiplier:** 20-40x
- **Allows time:** Can wait for right setups
- **If you miss one:** Still have 30 days to find another

### 1-Week 3x:
- **Moonshots needed:** 1-2 in 7 days
- **Average multiplier:** 15-30x
- **Time pressure:** Must take more Tier 1 shots
- **If you miss:** May not hit 3x goal

**V4 Bot Stats:**
- Captures 75-85% of moonshots
- 10-15% hit 15x+ per week
- Need to take 10-15 Tier 1 positions
- Probability: 70-80% of hitting at least one 15x+

---

## Risk Comparison

### Conservative Risk Profile:
```
Best Case:  +900% (10x)
Target:     +400% (5x)
Worst Case: -20% (stop out)

Risk/Reward: 1:20 to 1:45
Probability of Profit: 90%+
Max Drawdown: 20%
```

### 1-Week 3x Risk Profile:
```
Best Case:  +500% (6x)
Target:     +200% (3x)
Worst Case: -30% (stop out)

Risk/Reward: 1:6 to 1:15
Probability of Profit: 70-80%
Max Drawdown: 30%
```

**Conservative = Better risk/reward, slower**  
**1-Week 3x = Worse risk/reward, faster**
