# üìä Status Update - October 12, 2025 11:11 AM IST

## ‚úÖ **FIXES DEPLOYED**

### **1. FOMO Filter Debug Logging ‚úÖ**
**Problem:** FOMO filter wasn't rejecting late entries (tokens with 96-253% 24h pumps passing through)

**Root Cause:** `stats.change_24h` and `stats.change_1h` appear to be **None or 0** at the time of FOMO filter check, even though they show up correctly in alert logs later

**Fix Deployed:**
- Added debug logging to see actual values at filter check time:
  ```python
  self._log(f"üîç FOMO CHECK: {token_address[:8]}... ‚Üí 1h:{change_1h:.1f}%, 24h:{change_24h:.1f}% (threshold: {MAX_24H_CHANGE_FOR_ALERT:.0f}%)")
  ```
- Added error handling for log formatting issues
- Worker container rebuilt and deployed at 11:10 AM IST

**Status:** ‚úÖ **DEPLOYED** - Debug logs will confirm if change data is missing

## üî¨ **ML STATUS**

### **Current State:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  **ML Models NOT Trained on Server**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  **ML Scoring NOT Enabled**
- ‚úÖ **ML Code Ready** (improved with rug removal, regularization, cross-validation)
- ‚úÖ **Database has outcome data** (619 signals with performance tracking)

### **Why ML Isn't Active:**
1. ML models were trained **locally** but not deployed to server
2. `var/models/` directory doesn't exist on server
3. Environment variable `ML_SCORING_ENABLED` is `false` (default)

### **To Enable ML:**
1. Train models on server:
   ```bash
   ssh root@64.227.157.221
   cd /opt/callsbotonchain
   docker exec callsbot-worker python scripts/ml/train_model.py
   ```

2. Set environment variable in `deployment/.env`:
   ```bash
   ML_SCORING_ENABLED=true
   ```

3. Rebuild and restart worker:
   ```bash
   cd /opt/callsbotonchain/deployment
   docker compose build --no-cache worker
   docker compose up -d worker
   ```

### **ML Training Requirements:**
- **Minimum Data:** 50 samples with outcome data ‚úÖ (have 619!)
- **Clean Data:** Remove rugs from training ‚úÖ (implemented)
- **Features:** Complete feature extraction ‚úÖ (implemented)
- **Models:** Gain predictor + Winner classifier ‚úÖ (code ready)

**Verdict:** Ready to train, but need to execute training on server!

5. ‚úÖ **Notifications:** 100% delivery via Telethon fallback
6. ‚úÖ **Configuration:** Aligned and correct
7. ‚ö†Ô∏è  **FOMO Filter:** Found issue - change data missing at filter time
8. ‚úÖ **Performance Metrics:** Excellent (+119% avg gain)
9. ‚úÖ **Data Quality:** Good for ML training
10. ‚úÖ **Edge Cases:** NaN liquidity bug fixed (previously)

## üéØ **CRITICAL FINDING**

### **Late Entry Problem:**
Recent signals had excessive 24h pumps that should have been rejected:

| Token | Alert Time | change_24h | Status |
|-------|------------|------------|--------|
| 3jX3imAg | 03:25 | **253%** | ‚ùå Should reject at >50% |
| 814jozo | 03:56 | **160%** | ‚ùå Should reject at >50% |
| 8GBcQRg | 04:49 | **96%** | ‚ùå Should reject at >50% |
| DKpp6dRn | 04:54 | **96%** | ‚ùå Should reject at >50% |

**Hypothesis:** Data populated AFTER filter check, during alert formatting

**Debug Output Will Show:**
- If `change_24h` and `change_1h` are 0 at filter time ‚Üí Data flow issue
- If values are correct at filter time ‚Üí Logic issue

---

## üìÖ **NEXT STEPS**

### **Immediate (Next 1 Hour):**
1. ‚úÖ Monitor worker logs for "FOMO CHECK" debug output
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è  Wait for next token to reach FOMO filter
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è  Analyze debug output to confirm hypothesis

### **Short Term (Next 6 Hours):**
1. Fix data flow if confirmed missing
2. Verify late entries are blocked
3. Consider training ML models on server

### **Medium Term (Next 24 Hours):**
1. Train ML models on server (if desired)
2. Enable ML scoring (if models trained)
3. Monitor performance improvements

## üîß **HOW TO USE THIS UPDATE**

### **For Monitoring:**
```bash
# Check FOMO debug logs (wait for next signal):
ssh root@64.227.157.221 "docker logs callsbot-worker -f | grep 'FOMO CHECK'"

# Check system health:
ssh root@64.227.157.221 "cd /opt/callsbotonchain/deployment && docker compose ps"

# Check recent signals:
ssh root@64.227.157.221 "docker logs callsbot-worker --tail 100 | grep 'PASSED'"
```

```bash
# Train models on server:
ssh root@64.227.157.221
cd /opt/callsbotonchain
docker exec callsbot-worker python scripts/ml/train_model.py

# Enable ML scoring:
