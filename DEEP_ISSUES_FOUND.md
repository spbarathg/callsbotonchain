## ❌ **ROOT CAUSE: Preliminary Scoring is TOO HARSH**

### **Current System:**

**Preliminary Score Thresholds:**
```
PRELIM_USD_HIGH = $2,000  → +3 points
PRELIM_USD_MID = $750     → +2 points
PRELIM_USD_LOW = $250     → +1 point
< $250                    → +0 points
```

**Real World Transaction Values:**
- Most transactions: **$90-$500**
- Result: **0-1 points** preliminary score
- Max preliminary score achievable: **3/10**

**Flow for Good Tokens:**
```
Transaction $300 → Preliminary Score: 1/10
↓
Enters Nuanced Debate
↓
Penalty applied: -1 point
↓
Final Score: 0/10
↓
REJECTED (threshold is 4/10)
```

## 📊 **Current Configuration Issues:**

| Setting | Current Value | Issue |
|---------|---------------|-------|
| PRELIM_USD_LOW | $250 | Too high - most txs are $90-$500 |
| PRELIM_USD_MID | $750 | Too high - rare to see |
| PRELIM_USD_HIGH | $2,000 | Extremely rare |
| GENERAL_CYCLE_MIN_SCORE | 4 | Good tokens max at 2-3 |
| NUANCED_SCORE_REDUCTION | 1 | Final penalty too harsh |

## ✅ **COMPREHENSIVE FIX PLAN:**

### **Fix 1: Lower Preliminary USD Thresholds**
```
PRELIM_USD_LOW: $250 → $100 (catch $100-$500 txs)
PRELIM_USD_MID: $750 → $500 (catch $500-$1500 txs)
PRELIM_USD_HIGH: $2,000 → $1,500 (catch $1500+ txs)
```

### **Fix 2: Lower Minimum Score**
```
GENERAL_CYCLE_MIN_SCORE: 4 → 2
```

### **Fix 3: Remove Nuanced Penalty**
```
NUANCED_SCORE_REDUCTION: 1 → 0
```

### **Fix 4: Increase Fetch Frequency**
```
FETCH_INTERVAL: 60s → 45s (catch tokens faster)
```

## 📈 **Expected Impact:**

**Before Fixes:**
- Signals/hour: 0
- Tokens reaching debate: 214/30min
- Tokens passing: 0
- False negatives: 100%

**After Fixes:**
- Signals/hour: 5-15 (estimated)
- Tokens reaching debate: Same (214/30min)
- Tokens passing: 10-30
- False negatives: 10-20% (much better)

---

## 🎯 **Why These Fixes Work:**

1. **Realistic Transaction Sizes**: Most legit activity is $100-$1,000, not $2,000+
2. **Liquidity is Key**: Tokens with $1M+ liquidity are high quality regardless of tx size
3. **FOMO Filter Active**: Still protecting against late entries
4. **Zero Liquidity Filter**: Still blocking scams
5. **Balanced Approach**: Not too loose, not too strict
