## ðŸŽ¯ Use Cases

**For Analysts:**
1. Signal quality assessment (which scores win?)
2. Performance prediction models
3. Threshold optimization (liquidity, score minimums)
4. Smart money impact analysis
5. Conviction type performance comparison

**Example Analysis:**
```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('comprehensive_token_data.csv')

# Win rate by score
win_rate = df.groupby('final_score')['outcome_label'].apply(
    lambda x: (x.isin(['winner', 'winner_2x+', 'moonshot_10x+'])).mean()
)

# Average gain by conviction type
avg_gain = df.groupby('conviction_type')['max_gain_percent'].mean()

# Smart money impact
smart_money_win_rate = df.groupby('smart_money_detected')['outcome_label'].apply(
    lambda x: (x.isin(['winner', 'winner_2x+', 'moonshot_10x+'])).mean()
)
```
