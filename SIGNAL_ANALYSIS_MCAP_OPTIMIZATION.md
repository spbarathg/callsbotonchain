## CRITICAL INSIGHTS

### üéØ Sweet Spot Identified
**Target Range: 50k-150k Market Cap with 30k+ Liquidity**
- This range has **38.2% win rate** (vs 26.3% overall)
- Manageable rug rate of **46.1%** (vs 54.1% overall)
- Combined with 30k+ liquidity: **27.8-32.1% win rate**

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Problem
- Bot is currently set at **$20k MIN_LIQUIDITY_USD**
- This falls in the **13.4% win rate zone** (WORST performing!)
- Need to increase to **$30k-40k minimum**

### üìä Score Distribution
- Score 9 had **BEST win rate** at 31.9%
- Score 8 had 28.6% win rate (but more volume)
- Scores 5-7 still had 20-22% win rates (acceptable for diversification)

---

## RECOMMENDED CONFIGURATION CHANGES

### To Achieve 50% Win Rate:

1. **Increase Minimum Liquidity** ‚úÖ
   - FROM: $20,000 (13.4% win rate)
   - TO: $30,000-35,000 (27.8% win rate zone)

2. **Target Optimal Market Cap Range** ‚úÖ
   - Prefer: 50k-150k range (38.2% win rate)
   - Allow: Up to 200k for diversification
   - Avoid: Under 50k (77.2% rug rate) unless exceptional signals

3. **Adjust Score Threshold** ‚úÖ
   - Keep GENERAL_CYCLE_MIN_SCORE at 5-6
   - Add market cap/liquidity bonuses for sweet spot range
   - Maintain or increase score weight for security features

4. **Add Security Filters** ‚úÖ
   - Bonus for LP locked
   - Bonus for mint revoked
   - These reduce rug rate significantly

5. **Volume Requirements** ‚úÖ
   - Keep VOL_TO_MCAP_RATIO_MIN low (0.0-0.1)
   - This allows early entry before major pumps

With these changes:
- **Target Win Rate:** 40-50%
- **Risk Profile:** Medium (more aggressive on low caps)
