## üìä EXPECTED PERFORMANCE & SUCCESS METRICS

### Target Metrics (Week 1-4)
**Signal Frequency:** 20-25 signals/day (quality over quantity)  
**Target Win Rate:** 26-30% achieving 2x+ gains (up from 25.9% baseline)  
**Entry Point:** OPTIMAL ($50k-$100k market cap sweet spot)  
**Upside Potential:** 2x-5x (data-driven range)  
**Risk Level:** MODERATE (balanced quality + volume)

### How to Know If Bot Is On Track

#### ‚úÖ **GOOD SIGNS (Bot is working well)**

1. **Win Rate Trending Up**
   ```sql
   -- Check weekly win rate (should be 26%+)
   SELECT 
       ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN max_gain_percent >= 100 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 1) as win_rate
   FROM alerted_tokens a
   JOIN alerted_token_stats s ON a.token_address = s.token_address
   WHERE a.alerted_at > (strftime('%s', 'now') - 604800);
   ```
   - **Target:** ‚â•26% (baseline: 25.9%)
   - **Excellent:** ‚â•30%
   - **Review if:** <24%

2. **Consolidation/Dip Buy Patterns Performing**
   ```sql
   -- Check pattern performance
   SELECT 
       CASE 
           WHEN price_change_24h BETWEEN 50 AND 200 AND price_change_1h <= 0 THEN 'Consolidation'
           WHEN price_change_24h BETWEEN -50 AND -20 AND price_change_1h <= 0 THEN 'Dip Buy'
       END as pattern,
       COUNT(*) as signals,
       ROUND(AVG(max_gain_percent), 1) as avg_gain,
       ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN max_gain_percent >= 100 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 1) as win_rate
   FROM alerted_token_stats
   WHERE (price_change_24h BETWEEN 50 AND 200 AND price_change_1h <= 0)
      OR (price_change_24h BETWEEN -50 AND -20 AND price_change_1h <= 0)
   GROUP BY pattern;
   ```
   - **Consolidation Target:** 35%+ win rate
   - **Dip Buy Target:** 29%+ win rate

3. **Market Cap Distribution Correct**
   ```sql
   -- Verify signals are in 50k-100k range
   SELECT 
       COUNT(*) as signals_in_range,
       ROUND(AVG(first_market_cap_usd), 0) as avg_mcap
   FROM alerted_token_stats
   WHERE first_market_cap_usd BETWEEN 50000 AND 100000
   AND first_alert_at > (strftime('%s', 'now') - 604800);
   ```
   - **Target:** 100% of signals in $50k-$100k range
   - **Avg Market Cap:** ~$75k

4. **ML Enhancement Active**
   ```bash
   # Check ML is being used
   docker logs --tail 200 callsbot-worker | grep "ML models loaded"
   ```
   - **Should see:** "‚úÖ ML models loaded successfully"
   - **Check weekly retrain:** `/opt/callsbotonchain/data/logs/ml_retrain.log`

5. **Signal Volume Stable**
   - **Target:** 20-25 signals/day
   - **Too many (>40/day):** Filters too loose
   - **Too few (<10/day):** Filters too strict

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING SIGNS (Needs attention)**

1. **Win Rate Declining**
   - **If <24% for 3+ days:** Market conditions changed or config needs tuning
   - **Action:** Review recent losers for common patterns

2. **No Consolidation/Dip Buy Signals**
   - **If 0 pattern signals in 48h:** Momentum patterns not being detected
   - **Action:** Check if `price_change_1h` and `price_change_24h` are being captured

3. **Market Cap Drift**
   - **If signals outside $50k-$100k range:** Config not being enforced
   - **Action:** Verify `MAX_MARKET_CAP_USD=100000` in `.env`

4. **ML Not Loading**
   - **If "ML models not found" in logs:** Models missing or corrupted
   - **Action:** Run `docker exec callsbot-worker python scripts/ml/train_model.py`

5. **High Rug Rate**
   ```sql
   SELECT ROUND(SUM(is_rug) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 1) as rug_rate
   FROM alerted_token_stats
   WHERE first_alert_at > (strftime('%s', 'now') - 604800);
   ```
   - **Target:** <50% (current baseline)
   - **Warning if:** >60%
   - **Action:** Increase `MIN_LIQUIDITY_USD`

#### üö® **CRITICAL ISSUES (Immediate action required)**

1. **Win Rate <20% for 7+ days**
   - Market has fundamentally changed
   - Need to re-analyze data and adjust config

2. **Bot Not Sending Signals**
   - Check worker container status
   - Check Telegram/Telethon connectivity
   - Review error logs

3. **ML Retraining Failing**
   - Check `/opt/callsbotonchain/data/logs/ml_retrain.log`
   - Verify sufficient data (need 100+ signals)

### Weekly Review Checklist

**Every Monday, run these checks:**

```bash
# 1. Win rate last 7 days
ssh root@64.227.157.221 "docker exec callsbot-worker sqlite3 var/alerted_tokens.db \"
SELECT 
    'Last 7 days:' as period,
    COUNT(*) as signals,
    SUM(CASE WHEN s.max_gain_percent >= 100 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as winners_2x,
    ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN s.max_gain_percent >= 100 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 1) || '%' as win_rate
FROM alerted_tokens a
JOIN alerted_token_stats s ON a.token_address = s.token_address
WHERE a.alerted_at > (strftime('%s', 'now') - 604800);
\""

# 2. Market cap distribution
ssh root@64.227.157.221 "docker exec callsbot-worker sqlite3 var/alerted_tokens.db \"
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN first_market_cap_usd < 50000 THEN 'Below 50k'
        WHEN first_market_cap_usd < 100000 THEN '50k-100k (TARGET)'
        WHEN first_market_cap_usd < 200000 THEN '100k-200k'
        ELSE 'Above 200k'
    END as range,
    COUNT(*) as signals
FROM alerted_token_stats
WHERE first_alert_at > (strftime('%s', 'now') - 604800)
GROUP BY range;
\""

# 3. ML status
ssh root@64.227.157.221 "docker exec callsbot-worker python -c 'from app.ml_scorer import get_ml_scorer; ml = get_ml_scorer(); print(f\"ML Active: {ml.is_available()}\")'"

# 4. Pattern performance
ssh root@64.227.157.221 "docker logs --tail 500 callsbot-worker | grep -c 'CONSOLIDATION PATTERN\|DIP BUY PATTERN'"
```

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ Win rate: 26-30%

## ü§ñ ML SYSTEM STATUS

### Current ML Performance
- **Gain Predictor (Regression):**
  - Test R¬≤: -0.012 (poor predictive power)
  - Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è Provides bounded nudges only
  
- **Winner Classifier (2x+):**
  - Test Accuracy: 71.6%
  - Winner Precision: 21% | Recall: 40%
  - Status: ‚úÖ Modest predictive power

### ML Improvement Over Time

**What to Expect:**
- **Week 1-4:** ML performance stable (baseline)
- **Week 5-8:** Performance improves as more data accumulates

**Monitoring ML Progress:**
```bash
# Check ML metadata
ssh root@64.227.157.221 "docker exec callsbot-worker cat var/models/metadata.json"

# View last retrain log
ssh root@64.227.157.221 "tail -50 /opt/callsbotonchain/data/logs/ml_retrain.log"
```

**ML Performance Targets:**
- **Month 1:** Baseline (Test R¬≤ ~0.0, Acc ~72%)
- **Month 2:** Test R¬≤ > 0.1, Acc > 75%
- **Month 3:** Test R¬≤ > 0.2, Acc > 78%
- **Month 6:** Test R¬≤ > 0.3, Acc > 80% (ML becomes reliable)
