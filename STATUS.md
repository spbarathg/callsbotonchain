# Bot Status

**Updated:** October 22, 2025 (CRITICAL BUGS FIXED)
**Status:** PRODUCTION READY - System now functional (exits were broken!)

## System Verification Complete

### ‚úÖ Signal Processing
- Worker enforces Score 8+ filter
- Trader trusts all signals (TS_BLIND_BUY=true)
- **NO refiltering** - trades everything from Redis
- Avg signal quality: 8.13 (from 1,093 recent signals)

### ‚úÖ Exit Strategy
- **Stop Loss:** -15% from entry (checked every 2s)
- **Trailing Stop:** 10-20% from peak (score-based)
- **Peak Tracking:** Updates continuously
- **Thread-safe:** Position locks prevent race conditions

### ‚úÖ Dynamic Capital
- Reads actual SOL + USDC balance from wallet
- Position sizes scale as % of balance (not hardcoded)
- Balance cached 60s to prevent RPC spam
- **Example:** $20 ‚Üí $520 balance = positions scale 26x automatically

### ‚úÖ Big Returns Protection
- Trailing stops let winners run
- Locks in 80-90% of peak gains
- Score 7 gets 20% trail (more room for moonshots)
- Never sells on way up, only after pullback

## Monitoring

### Balance Check
```bash
docker logs callsbot-trader | grep "\\[WALLET\\]"
# Should show: "Balance: X SOL ($Y) + $Z USDC = $TOTAL total"
```

### Position Sizes
```bash
docker logs callsbot-trader | grep "open_position"
# Verify: "usd=X.XX" scales with balance (~25% of total)
```

### Exits Working
```bash
docker logs callsbot-trader | grep "exit_stop\\|exit_trail"
# Shows stop/trail triggers with PnL
```

### No Refiltering
```bash
docker logs callsbot-trader | grep "entry_rejected_low_score"
# Should be EMPTY (blind buy bypasses filtering)
```
