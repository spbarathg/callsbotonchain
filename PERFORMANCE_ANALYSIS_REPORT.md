## 🎯 **FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS**

### 1. Lower Score Threshold: 7 → 6
**Rationale:**
- Score 6 has 81.8% win rate (11 signals)
- Would increase signal volume by ~10-15%
- Captures more quality opportunities without flooding

**Change:**
```python
HIGH_CONFIDENCE_SCORE = 6  # Was 7
SMART_CYCLE_MIN_SCORE = 6  # Was 7
GENERAL_CYCLE_MIN_SCORE = 6  # Was 7
```

### 2. Lower Liquidity Threshold: $25k → $20k
**Rationale:**
- $25k-$50k range has 206% avg gain (best performance)
- Current $25k threshold misses lower end of sweet spot
- < $25k has low rug rate (16.9%) and decent performance (50% avg)

**Change:**
```python
MIN_LIQUIDITY_USD = 20000.0  # Was 25000.0
```

### 3. Optimize Market Cap Scoring
**Rationale:**
- $100k-$200k has 267% avg gain and 5 moonshots
- Need to give MORE bonus points to this range

**Change:**
```python
# Increase bonus for $100k-$200k sweet spot
MCAP_MICRO_MAX = 100000.0  # +3 bonus
MCAP_SMALL_MAX = 200000.0  # +2 bonus (INCREASED from +1)
```

### 4. Keep Smart Money Bonus at 0
**Rationale:**
- Smart Money signals underperform by 41%
- Non-Smart Money has 67.5% win rate vs 57.9%
- Already correctly set to 0

**No Change Needed** ✅
