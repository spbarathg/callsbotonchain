# üö® CRITICAL BUG: FOMO Filter Not Working

**Discovered:** October 12, 2025 - 11:00 AM IST  
**Severity:** CRITICAL - Allowing late entry signals (96-253% 24h pumps)

---

## üîç **Evidence**

### **Problem: Anti-FOMO Filter Not Executing**

**Expected Behavior:**
- Reject tokens with >50% change in 24h
- Log "EARLY MOMENTUM", "LATE ENTRY", or "FOMO CHECK PASSED"

**Actual Behavior:**
- ZERO FOMO filter logs in last 8 hours
- Tokens with 96%, 160%, 253% 24h change getting through
- Filter code exists but is NOT being called

### **Recent Signals That Should Have Been Rejected:**

| Token | Alert Time | change_24h | change_1h | Status |
|-------|------------|------------|-----------|--------|
| 3jX3imAg | 03:25:11 | **253.08%** | 1.58% | ‚ùå Should reject |
| 814jozo | 03:56:32 | **160.56%** | 165.07% | ‚ùå Should reject |
| 8GBcQRgu | 04:49:44 | **96.59%** | 92.30% | ‚ùå Should reject |
| DKpp6dRn | 04:54:28 | **96.85%** | 1.62% | ‚ùå Should reject |

**All of these are >50% threshold and should have been rejected!**

## üêõ **Root Cause Analysis**

### **Code Path Investigation:**

**Expected Flow (app/signal_processor.py lines 195-210):**
```python
195: if USE_LIQUIDITY_FILTER:
196:     if not self._check_liquidity(...):  # ‚úÖ This runs
197-202:     return ... (rejected)
203:
204: # ANTI-FOMO FILTER: Reject tokens that already pumped (late entry!)
205: if not self._check_fomo_filter(stats, token_address):  # ‚ùå This should run but doesn't log!
206-210: return ... (rejected)
```

**Actual Log Flow:**
```
‚úÖ LIQUIDITY CHECK PASSED: 3jX3imAgQKvkXCwWezrJzzfZXrtAg7rqoFxyPzSuPGpp - $37,533
(NO FOMO CHECK LOGS HERE!)
ENTERING DEBATE (No Smart Money; Strict-Junior failed): 3jX3imAgQKvkXCwWezrJzzfZXrtAg7rqoFxyPzSuPGpp
PASSED (Nuanced Junior): 3jX3imAgQKvkXCwWezrJzzfZXrtAg7rqoFxyPzSuPGpp
```

### **Hypothesis:**

1. **stats.change_24h and stats.change_1h are None or 0** at the time of FOMO filter check
2. The filter defaults to "FOMO CHECK PASSED: 0.0% in 24h" (line 436)
3. BUT even that log is not appearing, which means...

**CRITICAL ISSUE: The change data is populated LATER (during alert formatting), not during filtering!**

---

## üî¨ **Verification Needed**

Let's check when change data is populated:

1. **During stats fetch** (`TokenStats.from_api_response`) - Should have change data
2. **During FOMO filter check** - Data might be missing?
3. **During alert formatting** - Data is definitely there (shows in JSON logs)

**Key Question:** Is the API response missing `change.1h` and `change.24h` fields, or is there a data flow issue?

---

## üí° **Likely Causes:**

### **Option A: API Data Not Available**
- DexScreener/Cielo API doesn't always return change data
- `stats.change_1h` and `stats.change_24h` are always None
- Filter sees 0, logs "FOMO CHECK PASSED: 0.0%" (but this log is missing!)

### **Option B: Data Flow Issue**
- Stats are fetched but change fields not properly extracted
- `TokenStats.from_api_response` not parsing change data correctly
- Need to check `app/models.py` line 133-136

### **Option C: Log Filtering**
- Logs are generated but filtered out before display
- Unlikely - other logs show fine

---

## üéØ **Required Investigation**

1. Check if `stats.change_24h` is None during FOMO filter execution
2. Verify `TokenStats.from_api_response` is extracting change data
3. Check API responses for `change.1h` and `change.24h` fields
4. Add debug logging before FOMO filter to print actual values

---

## üö® **Impact**

**HIGH SEVERITY:**
- Bot is catching tokens AFTER they've pumped 100-250%
- Late entries result in immediate losses
- User complained about vitafin (-12% after alert)
- Contradicts the bot's "early entry" strategy

**Stats:**
- 619 lifetime signals
- 15.7% win rate (2x+ gains)
- 26% losers (160/615)
- **Recent signals are ALL late entries!**

---

## ‚úÖ **Next Steps**

1. Add debug logging to FOMO filter to see actual change values
2. Check `TokenStats.from_api_response` for change data extraction
3. Verify API responses contain change data
4. Fix data flow if needed
5. Rebuild worker container with fix
6. Monitor for "EARLY MOMENTUM" and "LATE ENTRY" logs
